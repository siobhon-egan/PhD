## Thesis format {-}

This thesis has been written to present data collected during the degree of Doctor of Philosophy as a coherent piece of work incorporating a series of stand-alone manuscripts.
Each manuscript is written according to the authorship guidelines of the journal that the manuscript is accepted for publication, submitted for review, or will be submitted to in the future. 
A statement of author attribution precedes each manuscript. 
All chapters are presented in a similar format with continuous referencing and table and figure numbering to maintain the continuity of the document.

This thesis is comprised of 7 chapters.
Chapter \@ref(litrev) comprises a literature review with an overview of ticks, tick-borne diseases and microorganisms.
In particular the review focuses on an Australian context and discusses the role of wildlife in the sylvatic cycle of microbes. 
Towards the end of chapter one the thesis aims are detailed \@ref(thesis-aims).  
The research chapters (2--6) are presented as individual scientific manuscripts and each contain their own abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. 
It is noted that as each research chapter is stand alone there are some repetitive aspects to this thesis. 
Modifications have been made to ensure consistency throughout this thesis and as such work presented here may differ slightly from any associated published work. 
The general discussion, chapter \@ref(gendiscussion) ties together major themes and findings presented in this thesis and provides a critical review on limitations and future directions.
To reduce redundancy some topics are not discussed in detail within the literature review and instead are included within the chapters.

All relevant data is made publicly available within this thesis. 
Data has been deposited to relevant repositories.
Nucleotide sequence data has been deposited to GenBank, raw Illumina MiSeq sequence data has been deposited to the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA). 
A data availability statement is provided at the start of each chapter.
Additional tables, figures and information are available in the Supplementary Material \@ref(supplementary-material).

**Scientific nomenclature**

Scientific names of ticks have been abbreviated as per @dantas-torresStandardizationAbbreviationsGenus2008 (typically utilising the first two letters of the genus, e.g. *Ixodes holocyclus* - *Ix. holocyclus*). 
In order to avoid confusion between two protozoal species of the genera *Trypanosoma* and *Theileria* the abbreviated notation of *Tr.* and *Th.* respectively has been used. 
For consistency these abbreviations have been used throughout the thesis and as a result may differ from published versions.

Mammal common and scientific names follow @jacksonTaxonomyAustralianMammals2015, except where there have since been changes published in the scientific literature. 
Where relevant previous mammal names (common or scientific) are included (denoted by *syn.*); these have been included in cases where the publication cited used different taxa name to those currently accepted, or as deemed relevant.
