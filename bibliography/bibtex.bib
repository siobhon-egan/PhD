This is a widespread tick species previously reported from Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. There is also a small population, probably introduced, at the foot of Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Our aim was to determine both the broad distribution of this tick on Yorke Peninsula and the pattern of dispersion between habitats. No free living A. t. triguttatum were found outside of Innes and Warrenben national parks, although records from humans are available from up to 180 km away. Within the parks, the tick is patchily spread in at least 8 of the 15 habitats searched but is most common in the disturbed areas in and around camping sites. We suggest that the behaviour of the tick's main host, the western grey kangaroo, Macropus fuliginosus, is responsible for its dispersion pattern.},

	volume = {3},
	abstract = {Interest in tick-transmitted pathogens has experienced an upsurge in the past few decades. Routine application of tools for the detection of fragments of foreign DNA in ticks, together with a high degree of interest in the quantification of disease risk for humans, has led to a marked increase in the number of reports on the eco-epidemiology of tick-borne diseases. However, procedural errors continue to accumulate in the scientific literature, resulting in misleading information. For example, unreliable identification of ticks and pathogens, erroneous interpretations of short-term field studies, and the hasty acceptance of some tick species as vectors have led to ambiguities regarding the vector role of these arthropods. In this review, we focus on the ecological features driving the life cycle of ticks and the resulting effects on the eco-epidemiology of tick-transmitted pathogens. We review the factors affecting field collections of ticks, and we describe the biologically and ecologically appropriate procedures for describing tick host-seeking activity and its correlation with environmental traits. We detail the climatic variables that have biological importance on ticks and explain how they should be properly measured and analyzed. We also provide evidence to critically reject the use of some environmental traits that are being increasingly reported as the drivers of the behavior of ticks. With the aim of standardization, we propose unambiguous definitions of the status of hosts and ticks regarding their ability to maintain and spread a given pathogen. We also describe laboratory procedures and standards for evaluating the vectorial capacity of a tick or the reservoir role of a host. This approach should provide a coherent framework for the reporting of research findings concerning ticks and tick-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {Some wildlife species are capable of surviving in urbanised environments. However, the implications of urbanisation on wildlife health, and public health regarding zoonoses, are often unknown. Quenda (syn. southern brown bandicoots, Isoodon obesulus) survive in many areas of Perth, Australia, despite urbanisation. This study investigated differences in gastrointestinal and macroscopic ecto-parasitic infections, morphometrics and reproductive status between bushland and urban dwelling quenda. 287 quenda in the greater Perth region were captured and sampled for faeces (to detect gastrointestinal parasites), blood (to detect Toxoplasma gondii antibodies), ectoparasites, and morphometrics. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic and linear regression. Most parasitic infections identified in quenda were of native parasite taxa that are either not known to, or considered highly unlikely to, infect humans or domestic animals. However, stickfast fleas (Echidnophaga spp.) were present at low prevalences and intensities, and Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Amblyomma spp. infections require further investigation to clarify their anthropozoonotic significance. Quenda captured in urbanised environments had differing odds of or intensity of certain parasitic infections, compared to those in bushland - likely attributable to quenda population density, and in some cases the availability of other host species or anthropogenic sources of infection. Urbanised environments were associated with an increase in net weight of adult male quenda by 189.0g (95\% CI 68.6-309.5g; p=0.002; adjusted R2=0.06) and adult female quenda by 140.1g (95\% CI 3.9-276.3g; p=0.044; adjusted R2=0.07), with study findings suggesting a tendency towards obesity in urbanised environments. Adult female quenda in bushland had increased odds of an active pouch (adjusted OR=4.89, 95\% CI 1.7-14.5), suggesting decreased reproductive activity in quenda from urbanised environments. These results highlight the subtle, yet extensive impacts that urbanised environments may have on wildlife ecology, even for those species which apparently adjust well to urbanisation.},

Despite the fact that R. rattus are nearly ubiquitous, few studies have investigated urban or peri-urban R. rattus as potential hosts for ticks. In this study, we identified the species of ticks that parasitize R. rattus in a remnant bush area within Sydney, Australia. We then examined the relationship between ticks and R. rattus by testing several rat body characteristics as predictors of tick abundance. We show that larva and nymphs of five species of native Australian tick parasitize R. rattus in urban Australia. The most abundance species was Ixodes holocyclus, a tick of veterinary and human health concern. We found that ticks were more abundant on R. rattus in better condition, for larva and nymphs of I. holocyclus and I. tasmani. Rattus rattus supports a rich assembly of ticks in a remnant forest in urban Australia, and as the R. rattus in best condition have the most ticks, tick parasitism at the levels observed does not appear to negatively impact R. rattus. Our findings illustrate that R. rattus, and other human commensal species, may be important hosts for ticks in human modified environments.},

Ticks were present on birds from April to November and absent from December to March, with a peak in tick prevalence between June and September. The peak in tick abundance coincided with the host breeding season. Across the year, the most prominent fluctuations in tick abundance occurred in birds that were previously characterized as having high tick prevalence. Tick abundance on passerines fluctuated with host availability and climatic conditions: more ticks were present in months with high humidity and rainfall and low temperature.

In this study, we used phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine the prevalence and intensity of ticks on passerines in South Australia and the role of abundance, body size and host foraging height for differences in prevalence and intensity of ticks. We examined 1262 birds for ticks between April 2004 and December 2006 at five sites across South Australia. All the ticks we collected were immature life-stages of Ixodes hirsti. Of the mist-netted birds, 347 (27.5\%) individuals were infested with an average of 2.8 ticks. Both prevalence and intensity of ticks varied significantly between host species. We found that body size was significantly correlated with tick prevalence, with larger hosts having higher tick prevalence. Abundance and mean foraging height did not explain the variance in prevalence or intensity of ticks.},

We found that the number of shrubs and the percentage of ground covered by shrubs were significant predictors of the presence of ticks: ticks were present only at sites with a dense cover of shrubs.

The aim of this study was to determine the host stimuli used by larval Ixodes hirsti for location of their passerine host. Additionally, we recorded the average questing height of larval ticks. We found that I. hirsti larvae were attracted to shade and heat, while they were unresponsive to host odor and CO2. The average questing height was 12.4 cm. Sensitivity to both shade and heat will aid larval I. hirsti in their ambush strategy to find a host. Preference for shaded environments and a low questing height favors the occurrence of larvae in high humidity environments. Such moist environments indirectly increase lifespan duration because of reduced movement for water sorption, and increase tick questing which is limited by vertical mobility. Additionally, larval ticks with a low questing height have a higher chance of encountering a ground foraging passerine host.},

In the present study, in vivo and in vitro examination of blood and cultures from Australian marsupials was conducted using light microscopy, immunofluorescence, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Promastigote, sphaeromastigote and amastigote life-cycle stages were detected in vivo and in vitro. Novel trypanosome-like stages were also detected both in vivo and in vitro representing an oval stage, an extremely thin stage, an adherent stage and a tiny round stage. The tiny round and adherent stages appeared to adhere to erythrocytes causing potential haematological damage with clinical effects similar to haemolytic anaemia. The present study shows for the first time that trypomastigotes are not the only life-cycle stages circulating within the blood stream of trypanosome infected Australian native marsupials and provides insights into possible pathogenic mechanisms of this potentially zoonotic trypanosome species.},

The present study describes the application of a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay to characterise the prevalence and genetic diversity of trypanosome communities in koalas and two native species of ticks (Ixodes holocyclus and I. tasmani) removed from koala hosts. Among 168 koalas tested, 32.2\% (95\% CI: 25.2-39.8\%) were positive for at least one Trypanosoma sp. Previously described Trypanosoma spp. from koalas were identified, including T. irwini (32.1\%, 95\% CI: 25.2-39.8\%), T. gilletti (25\%, 95\% CI: 18.7-32.3\%), T. copemani (27.4\%, 95\% CI: 20.8-34.8\%) and T. vegrandis (10.1\%, 95\% CI: 6.0-15.7\%). Trypanosoma noyesi was detected for the first time in koalas, although at a low prevalence (0.6\% 95\% CI: 0-3.3\%), and a novel species (Trypanosoma sp. AB-2017) was identified at a prevalence of 4.8\% (95\% CI: 2.1-9.2\%). Mixed infections with up to five species were present in 27.4\% (95\% CI: 21-35\%) of the koalas, which was significantly higher than the prevalence of single infections 4.8\% (95\% CI: 2-9\%). Overall, a considerably higher proportion (79.7\%) of the Trypanosoma sequences isolated from koala blood samples were identified as T. irwini, suggesting this is the dominant species. Co-infections involving T. gilletti, T. irwini, T. copemani, T. vegrandis and Trypanosoma sp. AB-2017 were also detected in ticks, with T. gilletti and T. copemani being the dominant species within the invertebrate hosts. Direct Sanger sequencing of Trypanosoma 18S rRNA gene amplicons was also performed and results revealed that this method was only able to identify the genotypes with greater amount of reads (according to NGS) within koala samples, which highlights the advantages of NGS in detecting mixed infections. The present study provides new insights on the natural genetic diversity of Trypanosoma communities infecting koalas and constitutes a benchmark for future clinical and epidemiological studies required to quantify the contribution of trypanosome infections on koala survival rates.},

	abstract = {A molecular survey was conducted to provide baseline information on the prevalence, genetic diversity and potential clinical impacts of blood-borne and enteric protozoans in native wild mammals from the Northern Territory (NT). A total of 209 blood and 167 faecal samples were collected from four target species; the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) and brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus). Blood samples were screened by PCR at the 18S rRNA gene for trypanosomes, piroplasms and haemogregarines, with faecal samples tested for Cryptosporidium spp. at the 18S rRNA locus, and for Giardia spp. at the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and 18S rRNA loci. The potential clinical impact was investigated by associating clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters with presence or absence of infection. Overall, 22.5\% (95\% CI: 17.0-28.8\%) of the animals tested were positive for haemoprotozoans. Trypanosomes were found in 26.6\% (95\% CI: 18.7-35.7\%) of the bandicoots and were identified as Trypanosoma vegrandis G6, except for one unique genotype, most similar to T. vegrandis G3 (genetic distance=7\%). The prevalence of trypanosomes in possums was 23.7\% (95\% CI: 11.4-40.2\%), and the genotypes identified clustered within the T. noyesi clade. The presence of Babesia sp. and Hepatozoon sp. was confirmed in bandicoots only, both at a prevalence of 9.7\% (95\% CI: 2.7-9.2\%). The total prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasites observed was relatively low (3\%; 95\% CI: 1.0-6.9\%). No evidence of clinical disease associated with protozoan parasitic infection was observed, however bandicoots positive for Trypanosoma exhibited a significantly lower packed cell volume (PCV) compared to negative bandicoots (p=0.046). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first research conducted in the NT to characterise protozoan parasites in threatened native mammals using both molecular and morphological tools; and to assess the potential clinical impacts of these agents. The absence of clear signs of major morbidity in infected animals seems to exclude a direct association between infections with these agents and possible population decline events in northern Australian native mammals. However until the cause(s) of population decline are ascertained for each individual mammal species, further studies are required. The outcome of the present investigation may be used to inform wildlife conservation and zoonotic disease programs.},

	abstract = {The order Piroplasmida encompasses two main families: Babesiidae and Theileriidae, containing tick-borne pathogens of veterinary and medical importance worldwide. While only three genera (Babesia, Cytauxzoon and Theileria) comprising piroplasm parasites are currently recognised, phylogenetic studies at the 18S rRNA (18S) gene suggest that these organisms represent at least ten lineages, one of which comprises the relatively unique and highly diverse Theileria spp. from Australian marsupials and ticks. As an alternative to analysing 18S sequences alone, sequencing of mitochondrial genes has proven to be useful for the elucidation of evolutionary relationships amongst some groups of piroplasms. This research aimed to characterise piroplasms from Australian native mammals and ticks using multiple genetic markers (18S, cytochrome c, oxidase subunit III (cox3) and cytochrome B (cytB)) and microscopy. For this, nearly complete piroplasm-18S sequences were obtained from 32 animals belonging to six marsupial species: eastern bettong (Bettongia gaimardi), eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), quokka (Setonix brachyurus) and Gilbert's potoroo (Potorous gilbertii). The organisms detected represented eight novel Theileria genotypes, which formed five sub-clades within the main marsupial clade containing previously reported Australian marsupial and tick-derived Theileria spp. A selection of both novel and previously described Australian piroplasms at the 18S were also successfully characterised, for the first time, at the cox3 and cytB loci, and corroborated the position of Australian native theilerias in a separate, well-supported clade. Analyses of the cox3 and cytB genes also aided in the taxonomic resolution within the clade of Australian Piroplasmida. Importantly, microscopy and molecular analysis at multiple loci led to the discovery of a unique piroplasm species that clustered with the Australian marsupial theilerias, for which we propose the name Theileria lupei n. sp.},

Blood samples collected from 554 live-animals and 250 tissue samples extracted from 50 carcasses of sick-euthanized or road-killed animals, belonging to 10 species of marsupials, were screened for the presence of trypanosomes using a PCR of the 18S rDNA gene. PCR results revealed a rate of infection of 67\% in blood and 60\% in tissues. Inferred phylogenetic trees using 18S rDNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) sequences showed the presence of eight genotypes that clustered into three clades: a clade including Trypanosoma copemani, a new clade closely related to Trypanosoma gilletti, and a clade including Trypanosoma H25 from an Australian kangaroo. Trypanosome infections were compared in a declining and in a stable population of the endangered Australian marsupial, the brush tailed bettong or woylie (Bettongia penicillata). This marsupial showed high rates of infection with Clade A genotypes (96\%) in the declining population, whereas in the stable population, Clade B genotypes were predominant (89\%). Mixed infections were common in woylies from the declining but not from the stable population. Histopathological findings associated with either mixed or single infections involving Clade A genotypes, showed a strong inflammatory process and tissue degeneration predominantly in heart, oesophagus and tongue. Trypanosomes were successfully grown in culture and for the first time we demonstrate that a genotype within Clade A has the capacity to not only colonize different tissues in the host but also to invade cells in vitro. These results provide evidence for the potential role of trypanosomes in the decline of a formerly abundant marsupial that is now critically endangered.},

Gracilinanus agilis was the most abundant species (N = 70; 48.6\%) and it was the only one with patent parasitemia. Characterization by mini-exon and 18SrDNA targets were achieved in 7/10 hemocultures with positive fresh blood examination, which confirmed the T. cruzi infection by Discrete Typing Units (DTU) TcI in single (N = 2) and mixed infections with other DTUs (N = 5). T. rangeli and T. dionisii were detected in skin fragments from Didelphis albiventris and Oecomys cleberi, respectively. G. agilis were found to be infected by L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis, while Leishmania sp. DNA was detected in the liver of Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomys expulsus. Subpatent infection by T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. was serologically detected in 15\% and 9\% of the small mammal fauna, respectively. Small mammals from Cumari are included in T. cruzi and Leshmania spp. transmission cycles, showing a higher diversity of trypanosomatid species and/or genotypes than that observed in canids of the same agroecosystem.},

	abstract = {The first autochthonous Leishmania infection in Australia was reported by Rose et al. (2004) and the parasite was characterised as a unique species. The host was the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) but the transmitting vector was unknown. To incriminate the biological vector, insect trapping by a variety of methods was undertaken at two field sites of known Leishmania transmission. Collected sand flies were identified to species level and were screened for Leishmania DNA using a semi-quantitative real-time PCR. Collections revealed four species of sand fly, with a predominance of the reptile biter Sergentomyia queenslandi (Hill). However, no Leishmania-positive flies were detected. Therefore, alternative vectors were investigated for infection, giving startling results. Screening revealed that an undescribed species of day-feeding midge, subgenus Forcipomyia (Lasiohelea) Kieffer, had a prevalence of up to 15\% for Leishmania DNA, with high parasitemia in some individuals. Manual gut dissections confirmed the presence of promastigotes and in some midges material similar to promastigote secretory gel, including parasites with metacyclic-like morphology. Parasites were cultured from infected midges and sequence analysis of the Leishmania RNA polymerase subunit II gene confirmed infections were identical to the original isolated Leishmania sp. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the closest known species to be Leishmania enriettii, with this and the Australian species confirmed as members of Leishmania sensu stricto. Collectively the results strongly suggest that the day-feeding midge (F. (Lasiohelea) sp. 1) is a potential biological vector of Leishmania in northern Australia, which is to our knowledge the first evidence of a vector other than a phlebotomine sand fly anywhere in the world. These findings have considerable implications in the understanding of the Leishmania life cycle worldwide.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-018-2775-y},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apicomplexan tick-borne pathogens that cause disease in companion animals include species of Babesia Starcovici, 1893, Cytauxzoon Neitz \& Thomas, 1948, Hepatozoon Miller, 1908 and Theileria Bettencourt, Franca \& Borges, 1907. The only apicomplexan tick-borne disease of companion animals that is known to occur in Australia is babesiosis, caused by Babesia canis vogeli Reichenow, 1937 and Babesia gibsoni Patton, 1910. However, no molecular investigations have widely investigated members of Apicomplexa Levine, 1980 in Australian ticks that parasitise dogs, cats or horses, until this present investigation. RESULTS: Ticks (n = 711) removed from dogs (n = 498), cats (n = 139) and horses (n = 74) throughout Australia were screened for piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. using conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. The tick-borne pathogen B. vogeli was identified in two Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latreille ticks from dogs residing in the Northern Territory and Queensland (QLD). Theileria orientalis Yakimov \& Sudachenkov, 1931 genotype Ikeda was detected in three Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann ticks from dogs in New South Wales. Unexpectedly, the exotic tick-borne pathogen Hepatozoon canis James, 1905 was identified in an Ixodes holocyclus Neumann tick from a dog in QLD. Eight novel piroplasm and Hepatozoon species were identified and described in native ticks and named as follows: Babesia lohae n. sp., Babesia mackerrasorum n. sp., Hepatozoon banethi n. sp., Hepatozoon ewingi n. sp., Theileria apogeana n. sp., Theileria palmeri n. sp., Theileria paparinii n. sp. and Theileria worthingtonorum n. sp. Additionally, a novel cf. Sarcocystidae sp. sequence was obtained from Ixodes tasmani Neumann but could not be confidently identified at the genus level. CONCLUSIONS: Novel species of parasites in ticks represent an unknown threat to the health of companion animals that are bitten by these native tick species. The vector potential of Australian ticks for the newly discovered apicomplexans needs to be assessed, and further clinical and molecular investigations of these parasites, particularly in blood samples from dogs, cats and horses, is required to determine their potential for pathogenicity.},

We assume that the rate varies among sites according to an invariant+gamma distribution, which has two parameters: the gamma parameter alpha and the proportion of invariable sites theta. Theoretical treatments on three, four, and five sequences have been conducted, and computer program have been developed. It is shown that rho = (1 + theta alpha)/(1 + alpha) is a good measure for the rate heterogeneity among sites. Extensive simulations show that (1) if the proportion of invariable sites is negligible, i.e., theta = 0, the gamma parameter alpha can be satisfactorily estimated, even with three sequences; (2) if the proportion of invariable sites is not negligible, the heterogeneity rho can still be suitably estimated with four or more sequences; and (3) the distances estimated by the proposed method are almost unbiased and are robust against violation of the assumption of the invariant + gamma distribution.},

We surveyed a range of vertebrates and blood-feeding invertebrates for trypanosomes by parasitological and PCR-based methods using primers specific to the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of genus Trypanosoma. Trypanosome isolates were obtained in culture from two common wombats, one swamp wallaby and an Australian bird (Strepera sp.). By PCR, blood samples from three wombats, one brush-tailed wallaby, three platypuses and a frog were positive for trypanosome DNA. All the blood-sucking invertebrates screened were negative for trypanosomes both by microscopy and PCR, except for specimens of terrestrial leeches (Haemadipsidae). Of the latter, two Micobdella sp. specimens from Victoria and 18 Philaemon sp. specimens from Queensland were positive by PCR. Four Haemadipsa zeylanica specimens from Sri Lanka and three Leiobdella jawarerensis specimens from Papua New Guinea were also PCR positive for trypanosome DNA. We sequenced the SSU rRNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes in order to determine the phylogenetic positions of the new vertebrate and terrestrial leech trypanosomes. In trees based on these genes, Australian vertebrate trypanosomes fell in several distinct clades, for the mostpart being more closely related to trypanosomes outside Australia than to each other. Two previously undescribed wallaby trypanosomes fell in a clade with Trypanosoma theileri, the cosmopolitan bovid trypanosome, and Trypanosoma cyclops from a Malaysian primate. The terrestrial leech trypanosomes were closely related to the wallaby trypanosomes, T. cyclops and a trypanosome from an Australian frog. We suggest that haemadipsid leeches may be significant and widespread vectors of trypanosomes in Australia and Asia. q 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Trypanosomes (genus Trypanosoma) are widespread blood parasites of vertebrates, usually transmitted by arthropod or leech vectors. Most trypanosomes have lifecycles that alternate between a vertebrate host, where they exist in the bloodstream, and an invertebrate host, where they develop in the alimentary tract. This raises the question of whether one type of host has had greater influence on the evolution of the genus. Working from the generally accepted view that trypanosomes are monophyletic, here we examine relationships between trypanosomes using phylogenies based on the genes for the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) and the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH). New analysis of a combined dataset of both these genes provides strong support for many known clades of trypanosomes. It also resolves the deepest split within the genus between the Aquatic clade, which mainly contains trypanosomes of aquatic and amphibious vertebrates, and a clade of trypanosomes from terrestrial vertebrates. There is also strengthened support for two deep clades, one comprising a wide selection of mammalian trypanosomes and a tsetse fly-transmitted reptilian trypanosome, and the other combining two bird trypanosome subclades. Considering the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts of each clade, it is apparent that co-speciation played little role in trypanosome evolution. However most clades are associated with a type of vertebrate or invertebrate host, or both, indicating that 'host fitting' has been the principal mechanism for evolution of trypanosomes.},

We investigated contacts within a population of adult Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) over a 6-month period and tested whether individual-level contact patterns were correlated with accumulation of bite wounds. Bite wounds are important in the spread of devil facial tumor disease, a clonal cancer cell line transmitted through direct inoculation of tumor cells when susceptible and infected individuals bite each other. We used multimodel inference and network autocorrelation models to investigate the effects of individual-level contact patterns, identities of interacting partners, and position within the social network on the propensity to be involved in bite-inducing contacts. We found that males were more likely to receive potentially disease-transmitting bite wounds than females, particularly during the mating season when males spend extended periods mate-guarding females. The number of bite wounds individuals received during the mating season was unrelated to any of the network metrics examined. Our approach illustrates the necessity for understanding which contact types spread disease in different systems to assist the management of this and other infectious wildlife diseases.},

	abstract = {The genomes of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major have been sequenced, but the phylogenetic relationships of these three protozoa remain uncertain. We have constructed trypanosomatid phylogenies based on genes for glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA). Trees based on gGAPDH nucleotide and amino acid sequences (51 taxa) robustly support monophyly of genus Trypanosoma, which is revealed to be a relatively late-evolving lineage of the family Trypanosomatidae. Other trypanosomatids, including genus Leishmania, branch paraphyletically at the base of the trypanosome clade. On the other hand, analysis of the SSU rRNA gene data produced equivocal results, as trees either robustly support or reject monophyly depending on the range of taxa included in the alignment. We conclude that the SSU rRNA gene is not a reliable marker for inferring deep level trypanosome phylogeny. The gGAPDH results support the hypothesis that trypanosomes evolved from an ancestral insect parasite, which adapted to a vertebrate/insect transmission cycle. This implies that the switch from terrestrial insect to aquatic leech vectors for fish and some amphibian trypanosomes was secondary. We conclude that the three sequenced pathogens, T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major, are only distantly related and have distinct evolutionary histories.},

Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets.

Partial sequence data were also obtained for T. binneyi from a platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) from Tasmania. Phylogenetic relationships between T. chelodina, T. binneyi and other species were examined by maximum parsimony and likelihood methods. The Australian tortoise and platypus trypanosomes did not exhibit any close phylogenetic relationships with those of mammals, reptiles or amphibians, but were closely related to each other, and to fish trypanosomes.

Fourteen dogs were positive for B gibsoni using IFAT and/or PCR-RFLP and all were American Pit Bull Terriers.

A nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was developed for the detection and differentiation of each of the piroplasm species currently known to infect dogs on the basis of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene. The assay can potentially amplify and discriminate between Theileria annae, Theileria equi, Babesia conradae, Babesia gibsoni, Babesia sp. (Coco) and each of the Babesia canis subspecies. Non-canine piroplasm species can also potentially be detected using the described assay, however amplification of Neospora caninum was also observed. The PCR was found to have a high detection limit, capable of detecting a 2.7x10(-7)\% parasitaemia or the equivalent of 1.2 molecules of target DNA when using DNA extracted from whole EDTA blood and detected a parasitaemia of 2.7x10(-5)\% using blood applied to both Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards and IsoCodetrade mark Stix. The application of blood samples to filter paper may greatly assist in piroplasm identification in regions of the world where local technologies for molecular characterisation are limited.

Ticks from long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta; n=71), eastern-barred bandicoots (Perameles gunnii; n=41), northern-brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus; n=19), southern-brown bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus; n=4), bandicoot sp. (n=2), flying foxes (Pteropus sp.; n=3), black rats (Rattus rattus; n=7), bush rats (Rattus fuscipes; n=4), brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula; n=19), ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus; n=12), short-eared possums (Trichosurus caninus; n=6), possum sp. (Trichosurus sp.; n=8), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; n=12) were analysed using piroplasm-specific 18S primers and Sanger sequencing. Seven Ixodes tasmani ticks from long-nosed bandicoots and bandicoots sp., three I. tasmani ticks and one Ixodes holocyclus tick from brushtail possums, and one Haemaphysalis longicornis tick from a red fox were positive for piroplasms. New genotypes, with sequences sharing 98\% nucleotide similarities with Theileria sp. K1 detected in a burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur), were identified from bandicoot ticks. New genotypes were detected in ticks from brushtail possums, which shared 98\% similarity with a Babesia sp. (JQ682877) previously identified in marsupials. Theileria orientalis was identified in the H. longicornis tick from the red fox. Babesia and Theileria spp. in the ticks parasitizing bandicoots and brushtail possums clustered closely with respective Babesia and Theileria clades derived from Australian marsupials. This represents the first detection of piroplasms in ticks parasitizing brushtail possums and a red fox in Australia.},

The trypanosomatid tree was rooted using rRNA sequences from two species from the suborder Bodonina. All methods showed that the mammalian parasite, Trypunosoma brucei. constitutes the earliest divergent branch. The remaining trypanosomes formed a monophyletic group. Within this group, the bird trypanosome was grouped with T. cruzi, while the elasmobranch trypanosome and the two fish trypanosome species formed a group with an affinity to T. rotatorium. Our results provide no evidence for co-evolution of trypanosomatids and their hosts, either vertebrate or invertebrate.

	abstract = {Extreme climatic conditions may alter historic host-pathogen relationships and synchronize the temporal and spatial convergence of multiple infectious agents, triggering epidemics with far greater mortality than those due to single pathogens. Here we present the first data to clearly illustrate how climate extremes can promote a complex interplay between epidemic and endemic pathogens that are normally tolerated in isolation, but with co-infection, result in catastrophic mortality. A 1994 canine distemper virus (CDV) epidemic in Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) coincided with the death of a third of the population, and a second high-mortality CDV epidemic struck the nearby Ngorongoro Crater lion population in 2001. The extent of adult mortalities was unusual for CDV and prompted an investigation into contributing factors. Serological analyses indicated that at least five "silent" CDV epidemics swept through the same two lion populations between 1976 and 2006 without clinical signs or measurable mortality, indicating that CDV was not necessarily fatal. Clinical and pathology findings suggested that hemoparsitism was a major contributing factor during fatal epidemics. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured the magnitude of hemoparasite infections in these populations over 22 years and demonstrated significantly higher levels of Babesia during the 1994 and 2001 epidemics. Babesia levels correlated with mortalities and extent of CDV exposure within prides. The common event preceding the two high mortality CDV outbreaks was extreme drought conditions with wide-spread herbivore die-offs, most notably of Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer). As a consequence of high tick numbers after the resumption of rains and heavy tick infestations of starving buffalo, the lions were infected by unusually high numbers of Babesia, infections that were magnified by the immunosuppressive effects of coincident CDV, leading to unprecedented mortality. Such mass mortality events may become increasingly common if climate extremes disrupt historic stable relationships between co-existing pathogens and their susceptible hosts.},

During this longitudinal field-based study, we monitored gastrointestinal, blood-borne and ectoparasite taxa infecting woylies (Bettongia penicillata) for up to 12 months following two fauna translocations to supplement existing wild woylie populations in three different sites (Dryandra, Walcott and Warrup East) within the south-west of Western Australia. We aimed to (a) identify changes in parasite community structure of both translocated and resident woylies following translocation; and (b) evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in translocated hosts. Destination site and time since translocation had the strongest effects on parasite prevalence and mean faecal egg counts following translocation. Ivermectin treatment did not significantly reduce parasite prevalence or mean faecal egg counts in treated hosts. Prior to translocation, parasite community composition differed significantly between woylies selected for translocation and resident woylies within each release site. Following translocation, the parasite communities of translocated and resident hosts converged to become more similar over time, with loss of parasite taxa and novel host-parasite associations emerging. This is the first study to examine changes to the broader parasite community in translocated and resident animals following translocation. The dominant sitespecific response of parasites following translocation reinforces the importance of incorporating parasite studies to enhance our fundamental understanding of perturbations in host-parasite systems during translocation, in particular the site-level drivers of parasite dynamics.},

Here, we investigate the effects of ivermectin treatment on communities of gastrointestinal parasites in translocated woylies (Bettongia penicillata). Faecal samples were collected at three time points (at the time of translocation, and 1 and 3 months post-translocation) and examined for nematode eggs and coccidian oocysts. Parasite prevalence and (for nematodes) abundance were estimated in both treated and untreated hosts. In our study, a single subcutaneous injection of ivermectin significantly reduced Strongyloides-like egg counts 1 month post-translocation. Strongyle egg counts and coccidia prevalence were not reduced by ivermectin treatment, but were strongly influenced by site. Likewise, month of sampling rather than ivermectin treatment positively influenced body condition in woylies post-translocation. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of ivermectin in temporarily reducing Strongyloides-like nematode abundance in woylies. We also highlight the possibility that translocation-induced changes to host density may influence coinfecting parasite abundance and host body condition post-translocation.},

	abstract = {Host-parasite relationships are complex, and in wild animal populations individuals are commonly co-infected with various parasite species or intraspecific strains. While it is widely recognised that polyparasitism has the potential to reduce host fitness and increase susceptibility to predation or disease, the role of polyparasitism in influencing translocation success has never been investigated. Here we review the consequences of translocation for the host-parasite infracommunity and demonstrate how translocation-induced perturbations to within-hostparasite relationships may exacerbate the negative impacts of polyparasitism to the detriment of host health and translocation success. We also consider the ecological and immunological effects of altering host-parasite assemblages during translocation, and illustrate how the use of anti-parasitic drugs can further modify parasite infracommunity dynamics, with unintended impacts on target and non-target parasites. Importantly, as the evolutionary and ecological significance of the host-parasite relationship is increasingly recognised, we discuss the benefits of conserving parasites during fauna translocations.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding how fauna translocation and antiparasitic drug treatment impact parasite community structure within a host is vital for optimising translocation outcomes. Trypanosoma spp. and piroplasms (Babesia and Theileria spp.) are known to infect Australian marsupials, including the woylie (Bettongia penicillata). However relatively little is known about these haemoparasites, or how they respond to management practices such as translocation. We monitored haemoparasites infecting woylies for up to 12 months during two fauna translocations to supplement existing woylie populations in three different sites (Dryandra, Walcott and Warrup East) within south-western Australia between 2014 and 2016, with the aim of investigating (i) how haemoparasite prevalence, Trypanosoma spp. richness and Trypanosoma spp. community composition varied over time and between different sites following translocation; and (ii) whether ivermectin treatment indirectly impacts haemoparasite prevalence. Using molecular methods, 1211 blood samples were screened for the presence of trypanosomes, and a subset of these samples (n=264) were also tested for piroplasms. Results: Trypanosomes and piroplasms were identified in 55\% and 94\% of blood samples, respectively. We identified five Trypanosoma species, two Theileria species, a single species of Babesia and a novel Bodo species. Trypanosoma spp. richness and the prevalence of haemoparasite co-infection increased after translocation. Prior to translocation, Trypanosoma spp. community composition differed significantly between translocated and resident woylies within Walcott and Warrup East, but not Dryandra. Six months later, there was a significant difference between translocated and resident woylies within Dryandra, but not Walcott or Warrup East. The response of haemoparasites to translocation was highly site-specific, with predominant changes to the haemoparasite community in translocated woylies occurring within the first few months following translocation. Ivermectin treatment had no significant effect on haemoparasite prevalence. Conclusions: This study contributes to our understanding of haemoparasite dynamics in woylies following translocation. The highly site-specific and rapid response of haemoparasites to translocation highlights the need to better understand what drives these effects. Given that haemoparasite prevalence and composition of translocated and resident animals changed significantly following translocation, we propose that parasite monitoring should form an essential component of translocation protocols, and such protocols should endeavour to monitor translocated hosts and cohabiting species.},

	abstract = {A range of protistan parasites occur in the blood of vertebrates and are transmitted by haematophagous invertebrate vectors. Some 48 genera are recognized in bood primarily on the basis of parasite morphology and host specificity; including extracellular kinetoplastids (trypanosomatids) and intracellular apicomplexa (haemogregarines, haemococcidia, haemosporidia and piroplasms). Gene sequences are available for a growing number of species and molecular phylogenies often link parasite and host or vector evolution. This review endeavours to reconcile molecular clades with biological characters. Four major trypanosomatid clades have been associated with site of development in the vector: salivarian or stercorarian for Trypanosoma, and supra- or peri-pylorian for Leishmania. Four haemogregarine clades have been associated with acarine vectors (Hepatozoon A and B, Karyolysus, Hemolivia) and another two with leeches (Dactylosoma, Haemogregarina sensu stricto). Two haemococcidian clades (Lankesterella, Schellackia) using leeches and mosquitoes (as paratenic hosts!) were paraphyletic with monoxenous enteric coccidia. Two major haemosporidian clades have been associated with mosquito vectors (Plasmodium from mammals, Plasmodium from birds and lizards), two with midges (Hepatocystis from bats, Parahaemoproteus from birds) and two with louse-flies and black-flies (Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon from birds). Three major piroplasm clades were recognized: one associated with transovarian transmission in ticks (Babesia sensu stricto); one with pre-erythrocytic schizogony in vertebrates (Theileria/Cytauxzoon); and one with neither (Babesia sensu lato). Broad comparative studies with allied groups suggest that trypanosomatids and haemogregarines evolved first in aquatic and then terrestrial environments, as evidenced by extant lineages in invertebrates and their radiation in vertebrates. In contrast, haemosporidia and haemococcidia are thought to have evolved first in vertebrates from proto-coccidia and then incorporated invertebrate vectors. Piroplasms are thought to have evolved in ticks and diversified into mammals. More molecular studies are required on more parasite taxa to refine current thought, but ultimately transmission studies are mandated to determine the vectors for many haemoprotozoa.},

Despite several decades of vector and parasite control efforts, it has not been eradicated. Alternative and sustainable control strategies require a sound knowledge of the local species, strains and vectors. In the Sudano-Sahelian and Guinea Savannah of Cameroon the prevalence and genetic diversity of trypanosomes infecting cattle was investigated by microscopy of cattle blood buffy coat and molecular methods using generic primers targeting parts of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) and encoded glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-gene (gGAPDH). Results: A total of 1176 randomly chosen cattle from five divisions in the Sudano-Sahelian and Guinea Savannah of Cameroon were examined. The overall prevalence of trypanosomes by microscopy was 5.9\% (56/953) in contrast to 53.2\% (626/1176) when molecular tools were used. This indicated a limited sensitivity of microscopy in subclinical infections with frequently low parasitemia. Three trypanosome species were identified by light microscopy: T. vivax (2.3\%), T. brucei (3.7\%) and T. congolense (3.0\%), whereas five were identified by PCR, namely T. grayi/T. theileri (30.8\%), T. vivax (17.7\%), T. brucei (14.5\%) and T. congolense (5.1\%). Unexpected cases of T. grayi (n = 4) and T. theileri (n = 26) were confirmed by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the gGAPDH revealed the presence of T. vivax, clade A and T. vivax clade C, which were co-endemic in the Faro et Deo division. T. grayi/T. theileri were the predominant species infecting cattle in tsetse free areas. In contrast, T. vivax, T. brucei and T. congolense were more abundant in areas where the Glossina-vectors were present. Conclusions: The abundance of pathogenic trypanosomes in tsetse infested areas is alarming and even more, the occurrence of T. vivax, T. brucei, T. congolense, T. theileri and T. grayi in tsetse-free areas implies that tsetse control alone is not sufficient to control trypanosomosis in livestock. To implement control measures that reduce the risk of spread in tsetse free areas, close monitoring using molecular tools and a thorough search for alternative vectors of trypanosomes is recommended.},

The order Piroplasmida shows a puzzling systematics characterized by multiple clades, soft polytomies and paraphyletic/polyphyletic genera. In the present study, screening of platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), was performed to infer the parasite molecular phylogeny. DNA was extracted from blood, ectoparasites and tick eggs and the 18S rRNA- hsp70-genes were used for the phylogenetic reconstructions. Microscopic analyses detected pleomorphic intra-erythrocytic organisms and tetrads consistent with previous descriptions of Theileria ornithorhynchi Mackerras, 1959, but observation of possible schizonts could not be confirmed. DNA sequences obtained from blood and ticks allowed resolving the systematics of the first piroplasm infecting a monotreme host. Molecularly, T. ornithorhynchi formed a novel monophyletic group, basal to most known piroplasms' clades. The ancestral position of this clade, isolated from an ancient lineage of mammalian host appears particularly fascinating. The present paper discusses the inadequacies of the current molecular systematics for the Piroplasmida and the consequences of incomplete sampling, morphology-based classification and ambiguous microscopic identifications. Likely when the current sampling bias is rectified and more sequence data is made available, the phylogenetic position of T. ornithorhynchi will be further contextualized without ambiguity.},

	abstract = {In the present study, the occurrence and molecular phylogeny of trypanosome parasites were studied in both wild and captive marsupials from Western Australia and Queensland. Blood samples were screened by PCR at the 18S rDNA locus, and the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Overall, 5.3\% of the blood samples were positive at the 18S rDNA locus. All positives belonged to wild-captured Western Australian individuals, where trypanosome-specific DNA was detected in 9.8\% of the screened samples from wild marsupials, in common brushtail possums, and woylies. The detection rate of trypanosome DNA in these two host species was 12.5\% and 20\%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on two loci, indicated that the possum-derived trypanosome isolates were genetically distinct, and most closely related to the Australian marsupial trypanosomes H25 from a kangaroo, and BRA2 from a bush rat. This is the first study to genetically characterise trypanosome isolates from possums. The analysis of the woylie-derived isolates demonstrated that this marsupial host can harbour multiple genotypes within the same geographical location and furthermore multiple genotypes within the same host, indicative of mixed infections. All the woylie-derived genotypes grouped with trypanosomes found in Australian marsupials, suggesting that they are more likely to belong to an endemic or Australasian trypanosome species. This is the first study to genetically characterise trypanosome isolates from possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Although the clinical significance of these infections is currently unknown, the identification of these novel sequences may support future investigations on transmission, threats to endangered wildlife, and evolutionary history of the genus Trypanosoma.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing species' demographic histories is a central focus of molecular ecology and evolution. Recently, an expanding suite of methods leveraging either the sequentially Markovian coalescent (SMC) or the site-frequency spectrum has been developed to reconstruct population size histories from genomic sequence data. However, few studies have investigated the robustness of these methods to genome assemblies of varying quality. In this study, we first present an improved genome assembly for the Tasmanian devil using the Chicago library method. Compared with the original reference genome, our new assembly reduces the number of scaffolds (from 35,975 to 10,010) and increases the scaffold N90 (from 0.101 to 2.164 Mb). Second, we assess the performance of four contemporary genomic methods for inferring population size history (PSMC, MSMC, SMCff, Stairway Plot), using the two devil genome assemblies as well as simulated, artificially fragmented genomes that approximate the hypothesized demographic history of Tasmanian devils. We demonstrate that each method is robust to assembly quality, producing similar estimates of Ne when simulated genomes were fragmented into up to 5,000 scaffolds. Overall, methods reliant on the SMC are most reliable between \$300 generations before present (gbp) and 100 kgbp, whereas methods exclusively reliant on the site-frequency spectrum are most reliable between the present and 30 gbp. Our results suggest that when used in concert, genomic methods for reconstructing species' effective population size histories 1) can be applied to nonmodel organisms without highly contiguous reference genomes, and 2) are capable of detecting independently documented effects of historical geological events.},

Quolls were assessed for the presence of selected potential pathogens (Toxoplasma gondii, herpesviruses, Salmonella serovars, hemoprotozoa, and ectoparasites). We assessed the relationships among sex, provenance (captive or free ranging), Toxoplasma gondii or herpesvirus infection, weight, and hematologic and biochemical variables. Six of 21 quolls (29\%) tested were seropositive for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Seropositive quolls weighed significantly more and had significantly lower potassium levels, anion gaps, and urea and triglyceride levels than seronegative quolls had. Eighteen of 31 (58\%) combined conjunctival-pharyngeal-cloacal swabs collected from quolls were PCR positive for a newly identified gammaherpesvirus, tentatively named dasyurid gammaherpesvirus 3. There were no significant differences among hematologic and biochemical variables or body weights from PCR-positive and PCR-negative quolls. Eighteen of 18 (100\%) of rectal-swab samples were culture negative for Salmonella serovars. Three species of tick (Ixodes tasmani, Ixodes fecialis, and Ixodes holocyclus), two species of mite (Andreacus radfordi, one unidentified), and four species of flea (Pygiopsylla hoplia, Acanthopsylla rothschildi rothschildi, Uropsylla tasmanica, and Stephanocircus dasyuri), were detected on wild-caught quolls, whereas a fifth species of flea, Echidnophaga myremecobii, was detected only on captive-bred quolls. Five of 15 blood samples (33\%) were positive for hemoprotozoan DNA via PCR, a novel Hepatozoon species, a novel Theileria species, Theileria paparinii, and Trypanosoma copemani were detected.

	abstract = {Models of nucleotide substitution are commonly used in the analysis of DNA sequences,especially in the estimation of evolutionary parameters and in the construction ofphylogenetic trees. A common problem that a researcher has to face is the objectiveselection of such a model. The program MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998) offerstwo sound statistical procedures to carry out this choice.The protocol given below describes the joint use of the programs MODELTEST andPAUP* (Swofford, 2000; UNIT 6.4) to select the best-fit model of nucleotide substitutionfor a given set of aligned DNA sequences. Users who are unfamiliar with PAUP* ormaximum-likelihood methods are encouraged to read UNIT 6.4. The three basic steps withinthis protocol consist of the estimation of a phylogenetic tree, the estimation of likelihoodscores for the candidate models, and the selection of a particular model given theselikelihood scores. The first two procedures are carried out in the program PAUP* with abatch file included in the MODELTEST package. The discussion in this unit summarizesthe theory behind the procedure and provides several caveats and guides for interpretationof the results. Particular comments about implementation on different platforms is alsogiven.Users can run PAUP* and MODELTEST either through a graphical user interface (GUI)or from a command line, depending on the platform. PAUP* is commonly used inMacintosh OS9, where a complete GUI application is available. In Windows, PAUP* hasa much simpler GUI, but enough for the purposes here. MODELTEST, however, onlyoffers the GUI for Macintosh; Windows and Unix-like environment users ofMODELTEST must run the program from the command line. The protocol describedbelow refers primarily to the GUI versions of PAUP* and MODELTEST. Step annotationsdescribe how each step can be accomplished from the command line.Both MODELTEST and PAUP* are available from their respective Web sites (see InternetResources), and users are encouraged to download the most current versions.MODELTEST is freely available, while PAUP* is commercial software licensed bySinauer},

Research on DFTD began 10 years ago, when nothing was known about the tumor and little about the devils. The depth of knowledge gained since then is impressive, with research having addressed significant aspects of the disease and the devils' responses to it. These include the cause and pathogenesis of DFTD, the immune response of the devils and the immune evasion mechanisms of the tumor, the transmission patterns of DFTD, and the impacts of DFTD on the ecosystem. This review aims to collate this information and put it into the context of conservation strategies designed to mitigate the impacts of DFTD on the devil and the Tasmanian ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Clonally transmissible cancers are somatic cell lineages that are spread between individuals via the transfer of living cancer cells. There are only three known naturally occurring transmissible cancers, and these affect dogs, soft-shell clams, and Tasmanian devils, respectively. The Tasmanian devil transmissible facial cancer was first observed in 1996, and is threatening its host species with extinction. Until now, this disease has been consistently associated with a single aneuploid cancer cell lineage that we refer to as DFT1. Here we describe a second transmissible cancer, DFT2, in five devils located in southern Tasmania in 2014 and 2015. DFT2 causes facial tumors that are grossly indistinguishable but histologically distinct from those caused by DFT1. DFT2 bears no detectable cytogenetic similarity to DFT1 and carries a Y chromosome, which contrasts with the female origin of DFT1. DFT2 shows different alleles to both its hosts and DFT1 at microsatellite, structural variant, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci, confirming that it is a second cancer that can be transmitted between devils as an allogeneic, MHC-discordant graft. These findings indicate that Tasmanian devils have spawned at least two distinct transmissible cancer lineages and suggest that transmissible cancers may arise more frequently in nature than previously considered. The discovery of DFT2 presents important challenges for the conservation of Tasmanian devils and raises the possibility that this species is particularly prone to the emergence of transmissible cancers. More generally, our findings highlight the potential for cancer cells to depart from their hosts and become dangerous transmissible pathogens.},

Here, we determined the sequences of the spliced leader (SL) genes of 21 isolates from cattle and 2 from water buffalo from distant regions of Brazil. Analysis of SL gene repeats revealed that the 5S rRNA gene is inserted within the intergenic region. Phylogeographical patterns inferred using SL sequences showed at least 5 major genotypes of T. theileri distributed in 2 strongly divergent lineages. Lineage TthI comprises genotypes IA and IB from buffalo and cattle, respectively, from the Southeast and Central regions, whereas genotype IC is restricted to cattle from the Southern region. Lineage TthII includes cattle genotypes IIA, which is restricted to the North and Northeast, and IIB, found in the Centre, West, North and Northeast. PCR-RFLP of SL genes revealed valuable markers for genotyping T. theileri. The results of this study emphasize the genetic complexity and corroborate the geographical structuring of T. theileri genotypes found in cattle.},

	abstract = {Trypanosoma spp. infection in wild mammals is detected mainly through parasitological tests that usually display low sensitivity. We propose the use of DNA extracted directly from blood clots (BC), which are neglected sources of DNA for diagnosis and identification of Trypanosoma spp. This approach followed by nested PCR targeting the 18S SSU rDNA demonstrated to be sensitive and suitable to evaluate the diversity of trypanosomes infecting sylvatic mammals, including subpatent and mixed infections. Infection was detected in 95/120 (79.2\%) samples from bats, carnivores and marsupials that included negative serological and hemoculture testing mammals. Thirteen Trypanosoma spp. or Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) were identified, including two new MOTUs. The high diversity of trypanosomes species and MOTUs infecting bats and marsupials showed that these hosts can be considered as bio-accumulators of Trypanosoma spp., with specimens of Didelphis spp. displaying the highest trypanosome diversity. The use of blood clots allowed direct access to non-culturable parasites, mixed infections, besides bypassing the selective pressure on the parasites inherent to cultivation procedures. Trypanosoma cruzi was the species found infecting the highest number of individuals, followed by T. lainsoni. Positive PCR for T. cruzi was observed in 16 seronegative individuals and 30 individuals with negative hemocultures. Also, T. lainsoni, previously found only in rodents, showed to be capable of infecting bats and marsupials. This finding makes it clear that some species of Trypanosoma are more generalist than previously thought. Molecular diagnosis using nested PCR from DNA extracted from BC allowed the increase of the knowledge about host-spectrum and distribution of Trypanosoma spp. and allowed the identification of new MOTUs.},

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 12 of these positives identified them as Theileria penicillata, and sequencing of cloned PCR products indicated that no other species of Theileria were present. Infected woylies had a lower body weight but microscopic evaluation of the blood films indicated that T. penicillata did not appear to cause red cell injury or anaemia.

Despite a clear indication that the parasites belong to the genus Leishmania, no assignation to a known Leishmania species could be made using these or other less conserved genetic loci such as the nontranscribed spacer of the mini-exon repeat. As is the case in humans, some but not all animals harbouring lesions had antibodies to the isolated parasites or to several other Leishmania species. The isolated parasites displayed two well characterised Leishmania glycoconjugates, the lipophosphoglycan and proteophosphoglycan. They were infectious for mouse macrophages in vitro and established long-term infection at 33 8C but not at 37 8C. Our findings raise the possibility of transmission to humans, which may be unrecognised and suggest the possibility that imported species of Leishmania could become endemic in Australia.},

In addition, blood smears were collected from 5 reptiles, including the water python, and examined for the presence of the parasite. Hepatozoon sp. DNA was detected in all tick and reptile species, with 57.7\% of tick samples (n = 187) and 35.6\% of blood smears (n = 35) showing evidence of infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene demonstrated that half of the sequences obtained from positive tick samples matched closest with a Hepatozoon species previously identified in the water python population. The remaining sequences were found to be more closely related to mammalian and amphibian Hepatozoon species. This study confirms that species of Amblyomma harbor DNA of the same Hepatozoon species detected in the water pythons. The detection of an additional genotype suggests the ticks may be exposed to 2 Hepatozoon species, providing further opportunity to study multiple host-vector-parasite relationships.},

In this study, we present a new nested PCR approach, building on a previously published PCR method, which has significantly improved performance. We compare the new method with some existing assays and show, by sequence-based data, that the higher detection rate is mainly due to superior detection of Plasmodium spp. infections, which often are of low intensity and, therefore, hard to detect with other methods.},

Between 2004 and 2010, it was responsible for 60\% of all waterborne protozoan parasitic outbreaks reported worldwide. Most sporadic infections in humans and almost all outbreaks are caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis. We report the development and validation of a quantitative qPCR assay using minor groove binder (MGB)-probes targeting a unique Cryptosporidium specific protein-coding gene, that directly detects, quantitates and identifies C. hominis and C. parvum in environmental and faecal samples. An internal amplification control (IAC) was also developed and included in this assay. The qPCR assay was compared with an 18S nested PCR assay for sensitivity and specificity. The analytical sensitivity for the qPCR assay was 1 oocyst and 1-10 oocysts for the 18S assay. Evaluation of analytical specificity of the qPCR assay revealed no cross-reactions with other genera and detected all C. parvum and C. hominis isolates correctly. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR was 100\% compared to 96.9\% and 98.4\%, respectively for the 18S assay. The qPCR assay was also highly reproducible with RSD (relative standard deviation) values of 1.4-9.4\%, when the assay was performed by four different technicians. When tested on water samples, the qPCR assay was more sensitive than the 18S assay, detecting positives in 37 of 138 water samples compared to 35 for the 18S locus. This qPCR assay should be a valuable tool for the detection and differentiation of C. hominis and C. parvum in both clinical and environmental samples.},

It is the source of some of the worst diseases affecting humans and is thought to have had a devastating impact on native wildlife, especially in island ecosystems. Black rat is likely to have arrived in Australia with the first European settlers, making it among the first of many alien species to invade the continent, and it is now widespread. Yet, its impacts on local wildlife have largely been overlooked. Here, we review the potential for black rat impacts in Australia in terms of its role as a source of disease and threats to wildlife and humans. We first summarise the global evidence for black rat impacts as background to the potential threats it poses and then focus specifically on emerging evidence available for Australian systems. We found a significant gap in our understanding of the ecology of black rats and the ecological role that it plays in Australia. This is despite its role as a source of a diverse range of diseases affecting humans and wildlife and its actions as a predator and competitor of native wildlife in Australia and elsewhere.},

Despite the global scale and inestimable cost of their impacts on both human livelihoods and natural ecosystems, little is known of the global genetic diversity of Black Rats, the timing and directions of their historical dispersals, and the risks associated with contemporary movements. We surveyed mitochondrial DNA of Black Rats collected across their global range as a first step towards obtaining an historical genetic perspective on this socioeconomically important group of rodents. We found a strong phylogeographic pattern with well-differentiated lineages of Black Rats native to South Asia, the Himalayan region, southern Indochina, and northern Indochina to East Asia, and a diversification that probably commenced in the early Middle Pleistocene. We also identified two other currently recognised species of Rattus as potential derivatives of a paraphyletic R. rattus. Three of the four phylogenetic lineage units within R. rattus show clear genetic signatures of major population expansion in prehistoric times, and the distribution of particular haplogroups mirrors archaeologically and historically documented patterns of human dispersal and trade. Commensalism clearly arose multiple times in R. rattus and in widely separated geographic regions, and this may account for apparent regionalism in their associated pathogens. Our findings represent an important step towards deeper understanding the complex and influential relationship that has developed between Black Rats and humans, and invite a thorough re-examination of host-pathogen associations among Black Rats.},

There was a tendency for rural areas to harbour more rat-borne microbes than urban areas regarding the brown rat, but the opposite could be observed for the black rat. The study clearly indicated that an improved surveillance on wild rats is needed in Europe, and further indicated the pathogens and geographical areas where the major focus is required.

This species is highly phylogenetically related to trypanosomes from other rodents (T. lewisi-like), and sporadically infects other mammals. T. lewisi may opportunistically infect humans, and has been considered an emergent rat-borne zoonosis associated to poverty. We developed the THeCATL-PCR based on Cathepsin L (CATL) sequences to specifically detect T. (Herpetosoma) spp., and assess their genetic diversity. This method exhibited high sensitivity using blood samples, and is the first molecular method employed to search for T. lewisi in its flea vectors. THeCATL-PCR surveys using simple DNA preparation from blood preserved in ethanol or filter paper detected T. lewisi in Rattus spp. from human dwellings in South America (Brazil and Venezuela), East Africa (Mozambique), and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR). In addition, native rodents captured in anthropogenic and nearby human settlements in natural habitats harbored T. (Herpetosoma) spp. PCR-amplified CATL gene fragments (253 bp) distinguish T. lewisi and T. lewisilike from other trypanosomes, and allow for assessment of genetic diversity and relationships among T. (Herpetosoma) spp. Our molecular surveys corroborated worldwide high prevalence of T. lewisi, incriminating Mastomys natalensis as an important carrier of this species in Africa, and supported its spillover from invader Rattus spp. to native rodents in Brazil and Mozambique. THeCATL-PCR provided new insights on the accurate diagnosis and genetic repertoire of T. (Herpetosoma) spp. in rodent and non-rodent hosts, revealing a novel species of this subgenus in an African gerbil. Phylogenetic analysis based on CATL sequences from T. (Herpetosoma) spp. and other trypanosomes (amplified using pan-trypanosome primers) uncovered rodents harboring, beyond mammal trypanosomes of different subgenera, some species that clustered in the lizard-snake clade of trypanosomes.},

	abstract = {We characterized four Brazilian trypanosomes isolated from domestic rats and three from captive nonhuman primates that were morphologically similar to T. lewisi, a considered non-pathogenic species restricted to rodents and transmitted by fleas, despite its potential pathogenicity for infants. These isolates were identified as T. lewisi by barcoding using V7V8 SSU rDNA sequences. In inferred phylogenetic trees, all isolates clustered tightly with reference T. lewisi and T. lewisi-like trypanosomes from Europe, Asia and Africa and despite their high sequence conservation formed a homogeneous clade separate from other species of the subgenus T. (Herpetosoma). With the aim of clearly resolving the relationships between the Brazilian isolates from domestic rats and primates, we compared sequences from more polymorphic ITS rDNA. Results corroborated that isolates from Brazilian rats and monkeys were indeed of the same species and quite close to T. lewisi isolates of humans and rats from different geographical regions. Morphology of the monkey isolates and their behaviour in culture and in experimentally infected rats were also compatible with T. lewisi. However, infection with T. lewisi is rare among monkeys. We have examined more than 200 free-ranging and 160 captive monkeys and found only three infected individuals among the monkeys held in captivity. The findings of this work suggest that proximity of monkeys and infected rats and their exposure to infected fleas may be responsible for the host switching of T. lewisi from their natural rodent species to primates. This and previous studies reporting T. lewisi in humans suggest that this trypanosome can cause sporadic and opportunistic fleaborne infection in primates.},

We surveyed rabbits and rabbit fleas (Spilopsyllus cuniculi) in Australia for the presence of trypanosomes using parasitological and PCR-based methods. Trypanosomes were detected in blood from the European rabbits by microscopy, and PCR using trypanosome-specific small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene primers and those in rabbit fleas by PCR. This is the first record of trypanosomes from rabbits in Australia. We identified these Australian rabbit trypanosomes as Trypanosoma nabiasi, the trypanosome of the European rabbit, by comparison of morphology and SSU rRNA gene sequences of Australian and European rabbit trypanosomes. Phylogenetic analysis places T. nabiasi in a clade with rodent trypanosomes in the subgenus Herpetosoma and their common link appears to be transmission by fleas. Despite the strict host specificity of trypanosomes in this clade, phylogenies presented here suggest that they have not strictly cospeciated with their vertebrate hosts. We suggest that T. nabiasi was inadvertently introduced into Australia in the 1960s in its flea vector Spilopsyllus cuniculi, which was deliberately introduced as a potential vector of the myxoma virus. In view of the environmental and economic damage caused by rabbits in Australia and other islands, the development of a virulent or genetically modified T. nabiasi should be considered to control rabbits.},

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that novel infectious disease can be a leading cause of serious population decline and even outright extinction in some invertebrate and vertebrate groups (e.g., amphibians). In the case of mammals, however, there are still no well-corroborated instances of such diseases having caused or significantly contributed to the complete collapse of species. A case in point is the extinction of the endemic Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari): although it has been argued that its disappearance ca. AD 1900 may have been partly or wholly caused by a pathogenic trypanosome carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), no decisive evidence for this scenario has ever been adduced. Using ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888-1908), we were able to resolve unambiguously sequence evidence of murid trypanosomes in both endemic and invasive rats. Importantly, endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of black rats were devoid of trypanosome signal. Hybridization between endemic and black rats was also previously hypothesized, but we found no evidence of this in examined specimens, and conclude that hybridization cannot account for the disappearance of the endemic species. This is the first molecular evidence for a pathogen emerging in a native mammal species immediately prior to its final collapse.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Background: The Australian paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus) is of significant medical and veterinary importance as a cause of dermatological and neurological disease, yet there is currently limited information about the bacterial communities harboured by these ticks and the risk of infectious disease transmission to humans and domestic animals. Ongoing controversy about the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the aetiological agent of Lyme disease) in Australia increases the need to accurately identify and characterise bacteria harboured by I. holocyclus ticks. Methods: Universal PCR primers were used to amplify the V1-2 hyper-variable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes present in DNA samples from I. holocyclus and I. ricinus ticks, collected in Australia and Germany respectively. The 16S amplicons were purified, sequenced on the Ion Torrent platform, and analysed in USEARCH, QIIME, and BLAST to assign genus and species-level taxonomy. Initial analysis of I. holocyclus and I. ricinus identified that {\textgreater} 95 \% of the 16S sequences recovered belonged to the tick intracellular endosymbiont "Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii" (CMM). A CMM-specific blocking primer was designed that decreased CMM sequences by approximately 96 \% in both tick species and significantly increased the total detectable bacterial diversity, allowing identification of medically important bacterial pathogens that were previously masked by CMM. Results: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was identified in German I. ricinus, but not in Australian I. holocyclus ticks. However, bacteria of medical significance were detected in I. holocyclus ticks, including a Borrelia relapsing fever group sp., Bartonella henselae, novel "Candidatus Neoehrlichia" spp., Clostridium histolyticum, Rickettsia spp., and Leptospira inadai. Conclusions: Abundant bacterial endosymbionts, such as CMM, limit the effectiveness of next-generation 16S bacterial community profiling in arthropods by masking less abundant bacteria, including pathogens. Specific blocking primers that inhibit endosymbiont 16S amplification during PCR are an effective way of reducing this limitation. Here, this strategy provided the first evidence of a relapsing fever Borrelia sp. and of novel "Candidatus Neoehrlichia" spp. in Australia. Our results raise new questions about tick-borne pathogens in I. holocyclus ticks.},

While numerous microbes have been identified inhabiting Australian Ixodidae, some of which are related to globally important tick-borne pathogens, little is known about the bacterial communities within ticks collected from Australian wildlife. In this study, 1,019 ticks were identified on 221 hosts spanning 27 wildlife species. Next-generation sequencing was used to amplify the V1-2 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene from 238 ticks; Amblyomma triguttatum (n=6), Bothriocroton auruginans (n=11), Bothriocroton concolor (n=20), Haemaphysalis bancrofti (n=10), Haemaphysalis bremneri (n=4), Haemaphysalis humerosa (n=13), Haemaphysalis longicornis (n=4), Ixodes antechini (n=29), Ixodes australiensis (n=26), Ixodes fecialis (n=13), Ixodes holocyclus (n=37), Ixodes myrmecobii (n=1), Ixodes ornithorhynchi (n=10), Ixodes tasmani (n=51) and Ixodes trichosuri (n=3). After bioinformatic analyses, over 14 million assigned bacterial sequences revealed the presence of recently described bacteria ' Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi', ' Candidatus Neoehrlichia australis', ' Candidatus Neoehrlichia arcana' and ' Candidatus Ehrlichia ornithorhynchi'. Furthermore, three novel Anaplasmataceae species were identified in the present study including; a Neoehrlichia sp. in I. australiensis and I. fecialis collected from quenda ( Isoodon fusciventer ) (Western Australia), an Anaplasma sp. from one B. concolor from echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) (New South Wales), and an Ehrlichia sp. from a single I. fecialis parasitising a quenda (WA).

A low rate of infestation by Ixodes ricinus nymphs was found in the small mammal populations studied that correlated with the near-absence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in 184 animals tested and with the lack of transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato to I. ricinus larvae that fed on them. In contrast, questing ticks collected at the same time and in the same areas were found to carry a highly variable B. burgdorferi sensu lato repertoire ( B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii , Borrelia valaisiana , and Borrelia afzelii ). Interestingly, the only isolate obtained from small mammals (R57, isolated from a bank vole) grouped by phylogenetic analyses with other Borrelia species but in a separate clade from the Lyme disease and relapsing fever organisms, suggesting that it is a new species. This new agent was widely distributed among small mammals, with infection rates of 8.5 to 12\% by PCR. Moreover, a high seroprevalence to B. burgdorferi sensu lato was found in the animal sera, suggesting cross-reactivity between B. burgdorferi sensu lato and R57. Although small mammals do not seem to play an important role as reservoirs for B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the study area, they seem to be implicated in the maintenance of spirochetes similar to R57.},

Of the various arthropods capable of transmitting pathogens that cause such diseases to humans, ticks, which are vec- tors of more kinds of pathogens than any other group of invertebrate, have become an increasing focus of attention. This is particularly the case in the temperate northern hemisphere where they are a significant vector of human disease. Here, we provide an overview of the complex ecological systems defining the various epidemiological cycles of tick-borne diseases. We highlight the abiotic and biotic factors influenc- ing the establishment and persistence of tick populations and their associated pathogens. Furthermore, we emphasize the dynamic nature of such systems, especially when they are under the influence of both small and large-scale anthropogenic changes to the environment. Although a great deal of work has been done on ticks and the diseases which they transmit, the very dynamism of the system means that new factors are continually arising which shift the epidemiological pattern within specific areas. We therefore consider that more detailed, long-term (i.e. at least 10 years), multidisciplinary studies need to be carried out to define why and how these pattern shifts take place and to determine their public health significance.},

	abstract = {Increases in tick-borne disease prevalence and transmission are important public health issues. Efforts to control these emerging diseases are frustrated by the struggle to control tick populations and to detect and treat infections caused by the pathogens that they transmit. This review covers tick-borne infectious diseases of nonrickettsial bacterial, parasitic, and viral origins. While tick surveillance and tracking inform our understanding of the importance of the spread and ecology of ticks and help identify areas of risk for disease transmission, the vectors are not the focus of this document. Here, we emphasize the most significant pathogens that infect humans as well as the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that they cause. Although detection via molecular or immunological methods has improved, tick-borne diseases continue to remain underdiagnosed, making the scope of the problem difficult to assess. Our current understanding of the incidence of tick-borne diseases is discussed in this review. An awareness of the diseases that can be transmitted by ticks in specific locations is key to detection and selection of appropriate treatment. As tick-transmitted pathogens are discovered and emerge in new geographic regions, our ability to detect, describe, and understand the growing public health threat must also grow to meet the challenge.},

Analyses of 16S rRNA and flaB genes identified three closely related genotypes of this bacterium (Borrelia sp. Aus A-C) that were unique and distinct from previously described borreliae. Phylogenetic analyses of flaB (763 bp), groEL (1537 bp), gyrB (1702 bp) and glpQ (874 bp) gene sequences and concatenated sequences (3585 bp) of three gene loci (16S rRNA, flaB and gyrB) were consistent with previous findings and confirm that this novel species of the genus Borrelia is more closely related to, yet distinct from, the Reptile-associated (REP) and Relapsing Fever (RF) groups. At the flaB locus, genotypes A, B and C shared the highest percentage sequence similarities (87.9, 88 and 87.9 \%, respectively) with B.orrelia turcica (REP), whereas at the groEL and gyrB loci, these genotypes were most similar (88.2-89.4 \%) to B.orrelia hermsii (RF). At the glpQ locus, genotypes A and B were most similar (85.7 and 85.4 \% respectively) to Borrelia sp. Tortoise14H1 (REP). The presence of the glpQ gene, which is absent in the Lyme Borreliosis group spirochaetes, further emphasises that the novel species of the genus Borrelia characterized in the present study does not belong to this group. Phylogenetic analyses at multiple loci produced consistent topographies revealing the monophyletic grouping of this bacterium, therefore providing strong support for its species status. We propose the name 'CandidatusBorrelia tachyglossi', and hypothesize that this species of the genus Borrelia may be endemic to Australia.

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-018-2775-y},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apicomplexan tick-borne pathogens that cause disease in companion animals include species of Babesia Starcovici, 1893, Cytauxzoon Neitz \& Thomas, 1948, Hepatozoon Miller, 1908 and Theileria Bettencourt, Franca \& Borges, 1907. The only apicomplexan tick-borne disease of companion animals that is known to occur in Australia is babesiosis, caused by Babesia canis vogeli Reichenow, 1937 and Babesia gibsoni Patton, 1910. However, no molecular investigations have widely investigated members of Apicomplexa Levine, 1980 in Australian ticks that parasitise dogs, cats or horses, until this present investigation. RESULTS: Ticks (n = 711) removed from dogs (n = 498), cats (n = 139) and horses (n = 74) throughout Australia were screened for piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. using conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. The tick-borne pathogen B. vogeli was identified in two Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latreille ticks from dogs residing in the Northern Territory and Queensland (QLD). Theileria orientalis Yakimov \& Sudachenkov, 1931 genotype Ikeda was detected in three Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann ticks from dogs in New South Wales. Unexpectedly, the exotic tick-borne pathogen Hepatozoon canis James, 1905 was identified in an Ixodes holocyclus Neumann tick from a dog in QLD. Eight novel piroplasm and Hepatozoon species were identified and described in native ticks and named as follows: Babesia lohae n. sp., Babesia mackerrasorum n. sp., Hepatozoon banethi n. sp., Hepatozoon ewingi n. sp., Theileria apogeana n. sp., Theileria palmeri n. sp., Theileria paparinii n. sp. and Theileria worthingtonorum n. sp. Additionally, a novel cf. Sarcocystidae sp. sequence was obtained from Ixodes tasmani Neumann but could not be confidently identified at the genus level. CONCLUSIONS: Novel species of parasites in ticks represent an unknown threat to the health of companion animals that are bitten by these native tick species. The vector potential of Australian ticks for the newly discovered apicomplexans needs to be assessed, and further clinical and molecular investigations of these parasites, particularly in blood samples from dogs, cats and horses, is required to determine their potential for pathogenicity.},

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) methodologies provide enormous potential to unravel these contingencies to improve our understanding, but their potential is only just starting to be realized. While recent work has largely focused on novel pathogen discovery at likely interfaces, high-throughput methods can also allow disease ecologists to better explore the critical effects of climate, seasonality, and land-use changes on EIDs. HTS can facilitate the creation of entire host-pathogen networks, integrate important microbiome and co-infection data, and even pinpoint important exposure routes at interfaces through environmental media. Here we highlight studies at the frontier of HTS and disease ecology research, identify current limitations, and outline promising future applications for EIDs.},

Results: We developed a new version of the MegaBLAST module of BLAST that does the initial phase of finding short seeds for matches by searching a database index. We also developed a program makembindex that preprocesses the database into a data structure for rapid seed searching. We show that the new `indexed MegaBLAST' is faster than the `non-indexed' version for most practical uses. We show that indexed MegaBLAST is faster than miBLAST, another implementation of BLAST nucleotide searching with a preprocessed database, for most of the 200 queries we tested. To deploy indexed MegaBLAST as part of NCBI'sWeb BLAST service, the storage of databases and the queueing mechanism were modified, so that some machines are now dedicated to serving queries for a specific database. The response time for such Web queries is now faster than it was when each computer handled queries for multiple databases.},

	abstract = {Background: Marsupials are born much earlier than placental mammals, with most crawling from the birth canal to the protective marsupium (pouch) to further their development. However, little is known about the microbiology of the pouch and how it changes throughout a marsupial's reproductive cycle. Here, using stringent controls, we characterized the microbial composition of multiple body sites from 26 wild Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats (SHNWs), including pouch samples from animals at different reproductive stages. Results: Using qPCR of the 16S rRNA gene we detected a microbial community in the SHNW pouch. We observed significant differences in microbial composition and diversity between the body sites tested, as well as between pouch samples from different reproductive stages. The pouches of reproductively active females had drastically lower microbial diversity (mean ASV richness 19 + - 8) compared to reproductively inactive females (mean ASV richness 941 + - 393) and were dominated by gram positive bacteria from the Actinobacteriota phylum (81.7-90.6\%), with the dominant families classified as Brevibacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Microbacteriaceae, and Dietziaceae. Three of the five most abundant sequences identified in reproductively active pouches had closest matches to microbes previously isolated from tammar wallaby pouches. Conclusions: This study represents the first contamination-controlled investigation into the marsupial pouch microbiota, and sets a rigorous framework for future pouch microbiota studies. Our results indicate that SHNW pouches contain communities of microorganisms that are substantially altered by the host reproductive cycle. We recommend further investigation into the roles that pouch microorganisms may play in marsupial reproductive health and joey survival.},

	abstract = {Ticks are globally distributed arthropods and a public health concern due to the many human pathogens they carry and transmit, including the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi . As tick species' ranges increase, so do the number of reported tick related illnesses. The microbiome is a critical part of understanding arthropod biology, and the microbiome of pathogen vectors may provide critical insight into disease transmission and management. Yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of the microbiome of wild ticks, including what effect the presence of multiple tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) has on the microbiome. In this study we chose samples based on life stage (adult or nymph) and which TBPs were present. We used DNA from previously extracted Ixodes scapularis ticks that tested positive for zero, one, two or three common TBPs ( B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti ). We produced 16S rRNA amplicon data for the whole tick microbiome and compared samples across TBPs status, single vs multiple coinfections, and life stages. Focusing on samples with a single TBP, we found no significant differences in microbiome diversity in ticks that were infected with B. burgdorferi and ticks with no TBPs. When comparing multiple TBPs, we found no significant difference in both alpha and beta diversity between ticks with a single TBP and ticks with multiple TBPs. Removal of TBPs from the microbiome did not alter alpha or beta diversity results. Life stage significantly correlated to variation in beta diversity and nymphs had higher alpha diversity than adult ticks. Rickettsia , a common tick endosymbiont, was the most abundant genus. This study confirms that the wild tick microbiome is highly influenced by life stage and much less by the presence of human pathogenic bacteria.},

The bacterial community structure of Rh. turanicus was characterized by high dominance of Coxiella and Rickettsia and extremely low taxonomic diversity. Parallel diagnostic PCR further revealed a novel Coxiella species which was present and numerically dominant in all individual ticks tested (n = 187). Coxiella sp. densities were significantly higher in female versus male ticks and were overall stable throughout the questing season. In addition, we revealed the presence of the novel Coxiella sp. in Rh. sanguineus adult ticks, eggs, and hatched larvae, indicating its vertical transmission. The presence of both spotted fever group Rickettsia spp. (SFGR) and non-SFGR was verified in the various individual ticks. The prevalence and density of Rickettsia spp. were very low compared to those of Coxiella sp. Furthermore, Rickettsia sp. densities were similar in males and females and significantly declined toward the end of the questing season. No correlation was found between Coxiella sp. and Rickettsia sp. densities. These results suggest different control mechanisms in the tick over its different bacterial populations and point to an obligatory and facultative association between the two tick species and Coxiella sp. and Rickettsia spp., respectively.},

Until recently, the only members of these genera reported in Australia (A. marginale, A. centrale, and A. platys) were introduced from other continents, through the importation of domestic animals and their associated ticks. However, unique Anaplasma and Ehrlichia 16S rRNA gene sequences were recently detected for the first time in native Australian ticks, particularly in Amblyomma triguttatum subsp. ticks from southwest Western Australia (WA). We used molecular techniques to survey Am. triguttatum subsp. ticks from four allopatric populations in southern and western Australia for Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species, and described here the phylogeny of these novel organisms. An A. bovis variant (genotype Y11) was detected in ticks from two study sites; Yanchep National Park (12/280, 4.3\%) and Barrow Island (1/69, 1.4\%). Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA and groEL gene sequences concluded that A. bovis genotype Y11 is a unique genetic variant, distinct from other A. bovis isolates worldwide. Additionally, a novel Ehrlichia species was detected in Am. triguttatum subsp. from three of the four study sites; Yanchep National Park (18/280, 6.4\%), Bungendore Park (8/46, 17.4\%), and Innes National Park (9/214, 4.2\%), but not from Barrow Island. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S, groEL, gltA, and map1 gene sequences revealed that this Ehrlichia sp. is most closely related to, but clearly distinct from, E. ruminantium and Ehrlichia sp.

	title = {Identification and characterisation of microorganisms in {Australian} wildlife tick},
	abstract = {Globally, ticks are well known vectors of a number of pathogens, including members of the genera Anaplasma, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Babesia, and Theileria, which are associated with a range of tick-borne diseases (TBD). These bacteria and blood-borne parasites are widely studied overseas due to their significant medical and veterinary impacts. In Australia, in recent decades, research into ticks and TBD has been focused on mammalian hosts, particularly livestock and companion animals. The relationship between wildlife and their ticks, on the other hand, are less studied. Despite disease concerns associated with ticks in Australia caused primarily by the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, and other introduced species such as the bush tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the impacts of native wildlife ticks are not known. The main objective of this thesis was to identify and characterise novel microorganisms and potential tick-borne pathogens residing in ticks that parasitise Australian wildlife. Wildlife ticks (n=1,000) were sourced across Australia from wildlife hospitals and sanctuaries, and genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from a subsample (n=196). Following the amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 hypervariable region, next generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform was used to assess the microbial composition. Results revealed the presence of a Borrelia species in Bothriocroton concolor ticks collected from echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), prompting further screening of additional B. concolor ticks (n=97) using primers targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), flagellin (flaB), the 60 kDa heat shock protein (groEL), the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (glpQ), and the DNA gyrase (gyrB) genes. Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Borrelia sp. identified in the B. concolor ticks was unique and distantly related to the Relapsing Fever Borrelia, with the reptile-associated (REP) Borrelia group, its sister taxa. Therefore, this novel species was described phylogenetically and named `Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi', representing the first Borrelia species to be molecularly characterised in native Australian ticks. Next Generation Sequencing analyses of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 hypervariable region also revealed the presence of Ehrlichia spp. belonging to the III Anaplasmataceae family, which were further characterised using Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, the citrate synthase (gltA) and groEL genes to evaluate the relationship between the Ehrlichia detected in the echidna ticks to other Ehrlichia spp. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Ehrlichia sequences derived from the echidna ticks were unique and shared the closest nucleotide identity (99.2\%) with `Candidatus Ehrlichia ornithorhynchi' detected in platypuses and I. ornithorhynchi ticks, clustering with `Candidatus Ehrlichia khabarensis' as their closest sister species, while dissimilar to other described Ehrlichia species. This thesis also presents the first identification of a Theileria fuliginosa-like species in Ixodes australiensis ticks collected from western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) in Western Australia. In addition, Theileria orientalis was identified in one Haemaphysalis longicornis tick from a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and new genotypes of Theileria and Babesia spp. were identified in ticks from bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), respectively. Collectively, phylogenetic analyses of the Babesia and Theileria spp. derived from Australian marsupials demonstrates that they are unique and different from their overseas counterparts. Currently, little is known about the pathogenicity of these newly identified bacteria and piroplasms in wildlife ticks. In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis provide an essential foundation for future research and valuable insights into the presence of important tick-borne microorganisms and the microbial diversity in ticks associated with Australian wildlife.},

Australian ecosystems have been under-explored for these potentially pathogenic organisms, and recent studies have identified a range of novel Ehrlichia, and their sister genera, Anaplasma and 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia' species, from native Australian ticks. We used bacterial 16S rRNA (16S) next-generation sequencing and genus-specific PCR to profile the bacterial communities in platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) blood samples and platypus ticks (Ixodes ornithorhynchi), and identified a high prevalence of Ehrlichia sequences. We also observed Ehrlichia-like intra-neutrophilic inclusions (morulae) in PCR-positive stained platypus blood films that were consistent in morphology with other Ehrlichia spp. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 16S (1343bp), gltA (1004bp), and groEL (1074bp) gene sequences group the platypus Ehrlichia with 'Candidatus Ehrlichia khabarensis' from far-eastern Russia, and demonstrate that the platypus Ehrlichia is clearly distinct from all other Ehrlichia spp. Enough genetic divergence exists to delineate this platypus Ehrlichia as a separate species that we propose to designate 'Candidatus Ehrlichia ornithorhynchi'. There is no evidence that 'Candidatus Ehrlichia ornithorhynchi' causes disease in wild platypuses, however, the organism does seem to be widespread in Australia, being found in both Queensland and Tasmania. 'Candidatus Ehrlichia ornithorhynchi' is the second native Australian Ehrlichia described and adds to the rapidly growing diversity of recently described native Australian tick-borne bacteria.},

	abstract = {Ticks have relatively complex microbiomes, but only a small proportion of the bacterial symbionts recorded from ticks are vertically transmitted. Moreover, co-cladogenesis between ticks and their symbionts, indicating an intimate relationship over evolutionary history driven by a mutualistic association, is the exception rather than the rule. One of the most widespread tick symbionts is Candidatus Midichloria, which has been detected in all of the major tick genera of medical and veterinary importance. In some species of Ixodes, such as the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus (infected with Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii), the symbiont is fixed in wild adult female ticks, suggesting an obligate mutualism. However, almost no information is available on genetic variation in Candidatus M. mitochondrii or possible co-cladogenesis with its host across its geographic range. Here, we report the first survey of Candidatus M. mitochondrii in I. ricinus in Great Britain and a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of tick and symbiont between British ticks and those collected in continental Europe. We show that while the prevalence of the symbiont in nymphs collected in England is similar to that reported from the continent, a higher prevalence in nymphs and adult males is apparent in Wales. In general, Candidatus M. mitochondrii exhibits very low levels of sequence diversity, although a consistent signal of host-symbiont coevolution was apparent in Scotland. Moreover, the tick MLST scheme revealed that Scottish specimens form a clade that is partially separated from other British ticks, with almost no contribution of continental sequence types in this north-westerly border of the tick's natural range. The low diversity of Candidatus M. mitochondrii, in contrast with previously reported high rates of polymorphism in I. ricinus mitogenomes, suggests that the symbiont may have swept across Europe recently via a horizontal, rather than vertical, transmission route.},

	abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Bartonella have been described in multiple mammalian hosts with many species capable of causing disease in humans. Cats and various species of rats have been reported to play a role as vertebrate hosts to a number of Bartonella spp. This study aimed to identify Bartonella spp. in Western Australia, Dirk Hartog Island (DHI), and Christmas Island (CI) and to investigate the presence of potential arthropod vectors. Feral cats were collected from CI (n = 35), DHI (n = 23) and southwest Western Australia (swWA; n = 58), and black rats were collected from CI (n = 48). Individuals were necropsied, ectoparasites were collected by external examination of carcasses, and splenic tissue was collected for polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect Bartonella DNA. Bartonella henselae DNA was detected from two cats and Bartonella koehlerae DNA from one cat in southwest WA, but Bartonella DNA was not identified in cats on DHI or CI. Bartonella phoceensis (28/48 = 58.3\%) and a novel Bartonella genotype (8/48 = 16.7\%) based on the internal transcribed space region were detected in the spleens of black rats on CI. Detection of Bartonella spp. in each location corresponded to the presence of ectoparasites. Cats from southwest WA harbored four species of fleas, including Ctenocephalides felis, and black rats on CI were infested with multiple species of ectoparasites, including mites, fleas, and lice. Conversely, cats on Dirk Hartog and CI were free of ectoparasites. This study has identified the DNA of Bartonella species from island and mainland swWA with some (B. henselae and B. koehlerae) of known zoonotic importance. This study further extends the geographical range for the pathogenic B. koehlerae. The association of Bartonella with ectoparasites is unsurprising, but little is known about the specific vector competence of the ectoparasites identified in this study.},

Numerous species of small mammals have been reported to play a role as a suitable reservoir to many pathogenic Bartonella. These infections are thought to be transmitted through blood-feeding arthropod vectors such as ticks, fleas and lice. The purpose of this study is to detect the presence of Bartonella species from tick samples collected from small mammals in mangrove forests of Peninsular Malaysia. Herein, 38 individual ticks and their small mammals host were evaluated for the presence of Bartonella DNA by conventional PCR targeting the 16S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) and partial sequencing of 460 bp from this locususing Bartonella genus-specific primers. Two tick individuals from Dermacentor auratus and Haemaphysalis hystricis collected from Rattus tiomanicus (host), were PCR-positive for Bartonella DNA amplification. No Bartonella amplification was possible in other tick species (Amblyomma sp.). Phylogenetic analysis of ITS fragments demonstrated that the sequences from ticks were closely related to Bartonella phoceensis, a species that has been reported from black rats (Rattus rattus) in Australia. This is the first report of a Bartonella bacteria detected in ticks from small mammals in Malaysia. Further research should be warranted to investigate the transmission of Bartonella and the potential impact of this zoonotic pathogen in animals and humans as this mangrove ecosystem is significant for local economy and tourism.},

For this aim, 160 mammals belonging to four species, and 218 associated arthropods were sampled. DNA was extracted and subjected to different Bartonella screening assays. Additionally, blood samples from 48 small rodents were submitted to liquid BAPGM culture followed by qPCR assay and solid culture. Two out of 55 Rattus captured in Santa Catarina state were PCR-positive for Bartonella when targeting the nuoG, 16S, and ITS loci. Sequences showed high homology with Bartonella coopersplainsensis. Conversely, all 48 small rodents, 14 capybaras and 43 opossum DNA samples from animals trapped in Mato Grosso do Sul were Bartonella negative in the HRM real time PCR assays targeting the ITS locus and gltA gene. Additionally, all mammal-associated ectoparasites showed negativity results based on HRM real time PCR assays. The present study showed, for the first time, the occurrence of B. coopersplainsensis in Brazil, shedding some light on the distribution of rats-related Bartonella in South America. In addition, the majority of rodents and marsupials were negative for Bartonella spp. Since B. coopersplainsensis reservoirs - Rattus spp. - are widely dispersed around the globe, their zoonotic potential should be further investigated.},

Trapping sites were selected around sheep farms (study 1, 2000 to 2002) and recreational parks (study 2, 2003 to 2005). The majority of the studied mammals (162) were wood mice ( Apodemus sylvaticus ), but six other different species were also analyzed: yellow-necked mice ( Apodemus flavicollis ), shrews ( Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus ), bank voles ( Clethrionomys glareolus ), domestic mice ( Mus domesticus ), and moles ( Talpa europaea ). The results showed an infection rate ranging from 10.7\% to 68.8\%, depending on the small mammal species. One C. russula shrew and one A. sylvaticus mouse gave positive reactions for A. phagocytophilum , and C. burnetii was detected in two domestic mice and one A. sylvaticus mouse in a farm. The DNA of Borrelia spp. was detected in 67 animals (26.5\%), most of them presenting positive hybridization with the probe for Borrelia sp. strain R57, the new Borrelia species previously detected in small mammals in our region. Furthermore, a second PCR and reverse line blot hybridization specific for B. burgdorferi sensu lato revealed the presence of Borrelia afzelii in 6.3\% of C. glareolus voles and 14.3\% of S. coronatus shrews. All small mammals were negative for spotted fever group rickettsiae. These results highlight the relevance of small mammals as reservoirs of some zoonotic bacteria.},

Sampling of white-footed mice allows for year-round B. burgdorferi surveillance as well as opportunities to establish the diversity of the different var- iants in a geographic region. This study explores the prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections in the tissues of white-footed mice, investigates the correlations between B. burgdorferi infected tissues, and determines the optimum field methods for surveillance of B. burgdorferi in P. leucopus. A total of 90 mice and 573 tissues (spleen, liver, ear, tongue, tail, heart, and kidney) were screened via nested PCR for B. burgdorferi infections. A large number of infec- tions were found in the 90 mice as well as multiple infections within individual mice. Infec- tions in a single mouse tissue (spleen, liver, ear, tongue and tail) were predictive of concurrent infection in other tissues of the same mouse at a statistically significant level. Ear tissue accounted for 68.4\% of detected infections, which increased to 78.9\% of the infected mice with the inclusion of tail samples. The use of ear punch or tail snip samples (used indi- vidually or in tandem) have multiple advantages over current Lyme disease ecological stud- ies and surveillance methodologies, including lower associated costs, minimization of delays, year-round B. burgdorferi testing opportunities, as well as longitudinal monitoring of B. burgdorferi in defined geographic regions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, per- sonal prevention measures are currently the most effective way to reduce Lyme disease transmission to humans. Thus, the identification and monitoring of environmental reservoirs to inform at-risk populations remains a priority. The sampling methods proposed in this study provide a reasonable estimate of B. burgdorferi in white-footed mice in a timely and cost-effective manner.},

In two artificial communities of known composition, our method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence variants from expected community members without residual errors. The measured abundances of intragenomic sequence variants were in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants within a genome. The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by our approach allowed Escherichia coli strains to be correctly classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in several E. coli strains. There are likely many applications beyond microbial profiling for which highthroughput amplicon sequencing of complete genes with single-nucleotide resolution will be of use.},

	abstract = {Background: Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA microbiome surveys performed with massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have transformed community microbiological studies. Current 16S profiling methods, however, fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution and accuracy to adequately perform species-level associative studies for specific conditions. This is due to the amplification and sequencing of only short 16S rRNA gene regions, typically providing for only family- or genus-level taxonomy. Moreover, sequencing errors often inflate the number of taxa present. Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio's) long-read technology in particular suffers from high error rates per base. Herein, we present a microbiome analysis pipeline that takes advantage of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) technology to sequence and error correct full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which provides high-fidelity species-level microbiome data. Results: Analysis of a mock community with 20 bacterial species demonstrated 100\% specificity and sensitivity with regard to taxonomic classification. Examination of a 250-plus species mock community demonstrated correct species-level classification of {\textgreater} 90\% of taxa, and relative abundances were accurately captured. The majority of the remaining taxa were demonstrated to be multiply, incorrectly, or incompletely classified. Using this methodology, we examined the microgeographic variation present among the microbiomes of six sinonasal sites, by both swab and biopsy, from the anterior nasal cavity to the sphenoid sinus from 12 subjects undergoing trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. We found greater variation among subjects than among sites within a subject, although significant within-individual differences were also observed. Propiniobacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes) was the predominant species throughout, but was found at distinct relative abundances by site.},

In addition, as these organisms represent a highly divergent evolutionary lineage, they are strikingly different from the common `model system' eukaryotes, such as some mammals, plants or fungi. A number of excellent reviews, published over the past decade, were dedicated to specialized topics from the areas of trypanosomatid molecular and cell biology, biochemistry, host-parasite relationships or other aspects of these fascinating organisms. However, there is a need for a more comprehensive review that summarizing recent advances in the studies of trypanosomatids in the last 30 years, a task, which we tried to accomplish with the current paper.},

To investigate an alternative, non-vector-based transmission method, we tested the hypothesis that raccoons scavenging on infected hosts results in patent infection. Macerated tissue from selected organs infected with amastigote stages of T. cruzi was orally administered to experimental groups of raccoons (n = 2/group) at 2, 12, or 24 hr after collection of the tissue samples. Additionally, raccoons (n = 1) in control groups were inoculated intravenously or per os with trypomastigotes. To further elucidate transmission routes of T. cruzi to raccoons, infected Rhodnius prolixus were fed to raccoons (n = 2). Raccoons did not become infected after ingestion of amastigote-infected tissues as evidenced by negative polymerase chain reaction results from blood and tissue, lack of seroconversion, and negative parasitemias. However, per os transmission can occur by ingestion of the infective trypomastigote stage or infected reduviid bugs. We conclude from these findings that oral transmission of T. cruzi may be a route of infection for wildlife in sylvatic cycles, but the scavenging behavior of animals is not likely a significant transmission route.},

We investigated T. cruzi infection in wild carnivores from three sites in Brazil through parasitological and serological tests. The seven carnivore species examined were infected by T. cruzi, but high parasitemias detectable by hemoculture were found only in two Procyonidae species. Genotyping by Mini-exon gene, PCR-RFLP (1f8/Akw21I) and kDNA genomic targets revealed that the raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) harbored TcI and the coatis (Nasua nasua) harbored TcI, TcII, TcIII-IV and Trypanosoma rangeli, in single and mixed infections, besides four T. cruzi isolates that displayed odd band patterns in the Mini-exon assay. These findings corroborate the coati can be a bioaccumulator of T. cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTU) and may act as a transmission hub, a connection point joining sylvatic transmission cycles within terrestrial and arboreal mammals and vectors. Also, the odd band patterns observed in coatis' isolates reinforce that T. cruzi diversity might be much higher than currently acknowledged. Additionally, we assembled our data with T. cruzi infection on Neotropical carnivores' literature records to provide a comprehensive analysis of the infection patterns among distinct carnivore species, especially considering their ecological traits and phylogeny. Altogether, fifteen Neotropical carnivore species were found naturally infected by T. cruzi. Species diet was associated with T. cruzi infection rates, supporting the hypothesis that predator-prey links are important mechanisms for T. cruzi maintenance and dispersion in the wild. Distinct T. cruzi infection patterns across carnivore species and study sites were notable. Musteloidea species consistently exhibit high parasitemias in different studies which indicate their high infectivity potential. Mesocarnivores that feed on both invertebrates and mammals, including the coati, a host that can be bioaccumulator of T. cruzi DTU's, seem to take place at the top of the T. cruzi transmission chain.},

Throughout their long history of domestication, they have served as a link for the exchange of parasites among livestock, wildlife, and humans and therefore remain an important source of emerging and re-emerging diseases. In Algeria, while canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is well known to be endemic, no data are available on other vectorborne protozoans. Here, we investigate the occurrence and diversity of trypanosomes, piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. and update the epidemiological status of CanL in dogs from Kabylia, northern Algeria. A total of 227 dogs from three regions of Kabylia were enrolled, including 77 dogs with clinical signs. Dogs were clinically examined and were tested for L. infantum antibodies using a Rapid Immuno-Migration (RIMTM) and a quantitative indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT). PCR screening and sequencing were performed for vectorborne protozoa. Sixty two percent (141/227) of dogs presented at least one infection, whereas 26\% (59/227) were co-infected. L. infantum antibodies were detected in 35.7\% (81/227) of dogs including 88.7\% (68/77) of sick dogs. Molecular investigation revealed prevalence of: 6.6\% (15/227), 13.2\% (30/227), 41\% (93/227) for Trypanosoma spp., B. vogeli and H. canis, respectively. T. evansi (3.1\%) and potential new subspecies of T. congolense had been identified. Dog"s clinical status correlates positively with L. infantum antibody titers and the presence of co-infections. Susceptibility to CanL varied according to the dog's aptitude and guard dogs were more infected (51\%) (P-value = .001). B. vogeli infection was more frequent in juveniles than adults (32\% vs 9\%, Pvalue {\textless} .001) and in females than males (21\% vs 10\%, P-value = .02). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on vector-borne protozoa infected dogs in Algeria. Current results are important not only for animal health, but also to avoid serious public health and livestock problems.},

A spotted fever group Rickettsia was detected in 45.5\% of samples of the tick Ixodes tasmani (n=44), from all trapping locations, sharing close sequence identity to members of the Rickettsia massiliae group.

	abstract = {Background: Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is currently divided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), named TcI-TcVI. TcII is among the major DTUs enrolled in human infections in South America southern cone, where it is associated with severe cardiac and digestive symptoms. Despite the importance of TcII in Chagas disease epidemiology and pathology, so far, no genome-wide comparisons of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of TcII field isolates have been performed to track the variability and evolution of this DTU in endemic regions. Results: In the present work, we have sequenced and compared the whole nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of seven TcII strains isolated from chagasic patients from the central and northeastern regions of Minas Gerais, Brazil, revealing an extensive genetic variability within this DTU. A comparison of the phylogeny based on the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes revealed that the majority of branches were shared by both sequences. The subtle divergences in the branches are probably consequence of mitochondrial introgression events between TcII strains. Two T. cruzi strains isolated from patients living in the central region of Minas Gerais, S15 and S162a, were clustered in the nuclear and mitochondrial phylogeny analysis. These two strains were isolated from the other five by the Espinhaco Mountains, a geographic barrier that could have restricted the traffic of insect vectors during T. cruzi evolution in the Minas Gerais state. Finally, the presence of aneuploidies was evaluated, revealing that all seven TcII strains have a different pattern of chromosomal duplication/loss. Conclusions: Analysis of genomic variability and aneuploidies suggests that there is significant genomic variability within Minas Gerais TcII strains, which could be exploited by the parasite to allow rapid selection of favorable phenotypes. Also, the aneuploidy patterns vary among T. cruzi strains and does not correlate with the nuclear phylogeny, suggesting that chromosomal duplication/loss are recent and frequent events in the parasite evolution.},

Recently, a number of novel Bartonella species and novel species candidates have been reported in marsupial fleas in Australia. In the present study the genetic diversity of marsupial fleas was investigated; 10 species of fleas were collected from seven different marsupial and placental mammal hosts in Western Australia including woylies (Bettongia penicillata), western barred bandicoots (Perameles bougainville), mardos (Antechinus flavipes), bush rats (Rattus fuscipes), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats (Felis catus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). PCR and sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the 18S rRNA genes from these fleas was performed. Concatenated phylogenetic analysis of the COI and 18S rRNA genes revealed a close genetic relationship between marsupial fleas, with Pygiopsylla hilli from woylies, Pygiopsylla tunneyi from western barred bandicoots and Acanthopsylla jordani from mardos, forming a separate cluster from fleas collected from the placental mammals in the same geographical area.

Rodents are reservoirs for most Bartonella spp. As the knowledge about Bartonella in rodents and their parasitizing ectoparasites is scarce in Germany, this study's objectives were to investigate Bartonella spp. in small mammals and in their ectoparasites. A total of 79 small mam- mals (seven species) were captured and their ectoparasites collected at seven sites around Leipzig, Saxony, Germany, in 2010 and 2011. Altogether, 79 spleen samples, 135 fleas (five species) and 365 ticks (three species) were investigated for Bartonella spp. by PCR targeting the ITS 16S-23S rRNA region. In total, 52 (65.8 \%) small mammals, 73 (54.1 \%) fleas and 51 (16.3 \%) ticks were positive for Bartonella spp. Most small mammals were positive for uncultured Bartonella sp. (n = 29) followed by Bartonella grahamii (n = 12), Bartonella taylorii (n = 8) and Bartonella sp. N40 (n = 3). Likewise, most fleas were positive for uncultured Bartonella sp.

This study's results suggest that rodents and fleas may be reservoirs and vectors, respectively. Zoonotic B. grahamii and B. elizabethae were found in ro- dents and their fleas. Therefore, humans may contract Bartonella infection by contact to wild rodents. Ticks seem of minor importance in transmitting Bartonella spp. found in fleas and rodents.

We investigated bacterial community composition and diversity of the ticks Dermacentor variabilis (n = 68) and Ixodes scapularis (n = 15) and blood of their shared rodent host, Peromyscus leucopus (n = 45) to quantify bacterial diversity and concordance. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97\% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs. Our results point to complex microbial assemblages inhabiting ticks and host blood including infectious agents, tick-specific endosymbionts and environmental bacteria that could potentially affect arthropod-vectored disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {A total of 1485 adult ticks were collected from mammalian hosts in south-eastern Sardinia, Italy, during the years 2007-2008. Ticks were identified and tested by PCR analysis for presence of Rickettsia species of the spotted fever group, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella species and Leishmania species. Among all tick species examined (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus pusillus, Hyalomma marginatum marginatum, Haemaphysalis sulcata and Dermacentor marginatus), only Hyalomma marginatum marginatum produced negative results. A total of 22 pools belonging to the three tick species Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.9 \%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (4.5 \%) and Rhipicephalus pusillus (100 \%) were positive for Rickettsia species, while a total of five pools belonging to Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.09 \%), Haemaphysalis sulcata (16.7 \%) and D. marginatus (7.8 \%) were positive for E. canis. Five pools of Rhipicephalus turanicus (1.8 \%) were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Positivity for C. burnetii was found in seven pools belonging to three tick species: Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.5 \%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (0.3 \%) and Haemaphysalis sulcata (4.4 \%). Finally, four pools belonging to Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.09 \%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (0.7 \%) and Rhipicephalus bursa (1.1 \%) were positive for Bartonella species. Leishmania species DNA was not detected in any of the tick pools examined. Data presented here increase our knowledge on tick-borne diseases in Sardinia, and provide a useful contribution to understanding their epidemiology.},

Bartonella species were detected using nested-PCR of the gltA gene and the 16S-23S ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and species were characterized using DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA, gltA, rpoB, ftsZ genes and the ITS region. Bartonella rattaustraliani and B. coopersplainsensis were detected in Ixodes spp. ticks and fleas (Stephanocircus pectinipes) respectively collected from rodents. Two novel Bartonella species were detected from marsupials; Candidatus Bartonella woyliei n. sp. was detected in both fleas (Pygiopsylla hilli) and ticks (Ixodes australiensis) collected from woylies and Candidatus Bartonella bandicootii n. sp. was detected in fleas (Pygiopsylla tunneyi) collected from western barred bandicoots. Concatenated phylogenetic analysis of all 5 loci clarified the marsupial cluster of Bartonella species in Australia and confirmed the species status of these two Bartonella species in ticks and fleas from woylies and western barred bandicoots, which are classified as threatened species and are vulnerable to extinction.},

The males associated with the females of one form could be distinguished by the ornamentation pattern, but no character was found to separate the males of the other forms. The available evidence is considered to favour a subspecific rather than a specific status for each form. However, as no substantial evidence was obtained of the presence of intermediates in the zones of contact between forms, a change of rank may be required when further material becomes available or cross-breeding is undertaken. The subspecies have been named A. t. triguttatum Koch, A. t. ornatissimum, subsp. nov., A. t. queenslandensis, subsp. nov., and A. t. rosei, subsp. nov. The morphological differences between these subspecies are discussed and their geographical and host ranges are recorded.},

Red kangaroos, Megaleia rufa, showed a higher incidence of complement-fixing antibodies (33 p.c.) than grey kangaroos, Macropus major (12 p.c.). In three areas, the incidence of complement-fixing antibody in M. rufa was between 46 and 54 p.c. C. burneti was isolated in mice from the blood of one Macropus major. Thirteen isolations were made from nearly 3,000 ornate kangaroo ticks, Amblyomma triguttatum, collected from kangaroos, goats and sheep. The titre of infectivity of infected ticks for mice was usually in the range 10-6 to 10-9. Infection of kangaroos and A. triguttatum was found over a considerable area, between 24 and 28degree S. and 144 and 149degree E., in western Queensland. It thus seems probable that a natural kangaroo-tick cycle exists. The three-host life cycle and wide host range of this tick would allow it to spread infection to domestic animals as well as kangaroos. Infestation of sheep would bring infected ticks into contact also with workers in the sheep-shearing industry, and was probably responsible for recent outbreaks of Q fever among them.},

Subsequent isolation of this rickettsia (strain BWI-1) in cell culture and analysis of its phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic relationships with type strains of Rickettsia species with standing in nomenclature suggested that it was sufficiently divergent to warrant its classification as a new species. Multiple gene comparison of strain BWI-1 revealed degrees of sequence similarity with Rickettsia raoultii, its closest relative, of 99.58, 98.89, 97.03, 96.93 and 95.73\% for the 16S rRNA, citrate synthase, ompA, ompB and sca4 genes, respectively.

In the last twenty-five years there have been over 500 reports of an Australian Lyme-like syndrome in the scientific literature. However, the diagnoses of Lyme Borreliosis made in these cases have been primarily by clinical presentation and laboratory results of tentative reliability and the true cause of these illnesses remains unknown. A number of animals have been introduced to Australia that may act as B. burgdorferi s. l. reservoirs in Lyme-endemic countries, and there are some Australian Ixodes spp. and Haemaphysalis spp. ticks whose geographical distribution matches that of the Australian Lyme-like cases. Four published studies have searched for Borrelia in Australian ticks, with contradicting results. The cause of the potential Lyme-like disease in Australia remains to be defined. The evidence to date as to whether these illnesses are caused by a Borrelia species, another tick borne pathogen or are due to a novel or unrelated aetiology is summarised in this review.},

Our analyses show that there are two species of Ixodes in eastern Australia that cause paralysis in dogs and other mammals: I. holocyclus and I. cornuatus. Further, we conclude that the morphological criteria used to differentiate female I. holocyclus and I. cornuatus are equivocal but I. holocyclus can be distinguished from I. cornuatus using COX1 and/or ITS2 sequences. Intraspecific genetic variation in I. holocyclus and I. cornuatus was less than 0.86\% and 0.19\% for COX1 and ITS2, respectively. Ixodes holocyclus could be genetically distinguished between different geographic ranges. There were no significant genetic differences between I. cornuatus from Tasmania and mainland Australia, but there are some COX1 haplotypes of I. cornuatus from the mainland that were not detected in Tasmanian and vice versa.},

The egg was the most vulnerable stage to high saturation deficit (low humidity) but some did survive in constant conditions of 16-17 mm Hg, showing an adaptation to harsh environments; A. t. triguttatum survives in a semi-desert habitat. The longevity of the unfed stages increased from the larvae, nymphs to adults. The longevity decreased with increase of temperature and decrease of humidity with the exception of adults maintained at 30degreeC and 16-17 mm Hg, which had a longer viability to the same saturation deficit at 20degreeC (50\% mortality) and 25degreeC (50\% and 100\% mortality).},

The peak of detachment was seven days after infestation for nymphs of either sex fed on rabbits and eight days for those fed on rats. The final weight of nymphs of either sex was not related to the feeding period. The premouit time at 30degreeC and 2-3 mm Hg saturation deficit in darkness was longer in female nymphs (19.7 days) than in males (17.7 days). Heavier engorged larvae produced heavier engorged nymphs which, in turn, gave rise to more females than males. Prediction of the sex of nymphs using engorgement weights was unreliable due to weight overlap. The different sizes of male and female nymphs must create problems in developing a technique for accurately evaluating field populations on hosts of bisexual three-host ticks. The different premouit periods and weights of male and female nymphs must be taken into account in experimental designs involving engorged nymphs.},

In 2000, the species was detected on southern Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. We aimed to identify A. triguttatum triguttatum's hosts through trapping, sampling of carcasses, and opportunistic capture of vertebrates on Yorke Peninsula. A. triguttatum triguttatum was removed from black rats (Rattus rattus), wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus), Tammar wallabies (M. eugenii eugenii), domesticated cats and dogs, and humans. Before this study, A. triguttatum triguttatum had not been found on black rats or rabbits in the wild. This research has implications for the management of wildlife, livestock, and visitors on Yorke Peninsula. The potential for A. triguttatum triguttatum to spread to other areas of Yorke Peninsula and South Australia is considerable, as visitors (tourists) to southern Yorke Peninsula report the presence of ticks both on themselves and among camping equipment on arriving home.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among tick lineages has been limited by the lack of resolution provided by the most commonly used phylogenetic markers. Mitochondrial genomes are increasingly used to address controversial phylogenetic relationships. To date, the complete mitochondrial genomes of eleven tick species have been sequenced; however, only three of these species are metastriate ticks, the most speciose lineage of ticks. In this study, we present the nucleotide sequences of the complete mitochondrial genomes of five more species of metastriate ticks: Amblyomma elaphense, Amblyomma fimbriatum, Amblyomma sphenodonti, Bothriocroton concolor and Bothriocroton undatum. We use complete mitochondrial genome sequences to address the phylogenetic placement of two morphologically 'primitive' species -Am. elaphense and Am. sphenodonti - with respect to the genus Amblyomma. Our analysis of these five mitochondrial genomes with the other eleven tick mitochondrial genomes, as well as analysis of nuclear rRNA genes, provides strong evidence that the genus Amblyomma is polyphyletic with the inclusion of Am. sphenodonti and Am. elaphense. A new genus or two new genera may be required to describe Am. sphenodonti and Am. elaphense. It is also possible that these two species are sisters to two established genera, Bothriocroton in the case of Am. sphenodonti, and Haemaphysalis in the case of Am. elaphense. However, other arrangements of these taxa cannot be excluded with the current data. Thus, while Am. sphenodonti and Am. elaphense do not belong in the genus Amblyomma, the phylogenetic placement of these two species cannot be resolved without more data from metastriate ticks, either greater sampling of mitochondrial genomes, or a large data set of nuclear genes.},

We also sequenced two thirds (ca. 9500bp) of the mitochondrial genomes of H. humerosa and H. hystricis. We used these 5 mitochondrial genome sequences together with the 13 tick mitochondrial genomes we sequenced previously and the 2 tick mitochondrial genomes sequenced by Black and Roehrdanz (1998), as well as the nuclear rRNA genes from 84 ticks and mites, in phylogenetic analyses. Our analyses reveal deep phylogenetic structure within the genus Haemaphysalis, with at least 2 species, H. parva and H. inermis that are highly divergent from the rest of the genus Haemaphysalis. We identify a region of the 18S rRNA gene which correlates with this division of the genus Haemaphysalis as well as a novel insertion in the mitochondrial genome of H. parva. We reject the hypotheses of Hoogstraal and Aeschlimann (1982) and Barker and Murrell (2004) on the relationships among metastriate genera. Instead, our analysis provides further evidence for the division of the Metastriata into 2 major lineages: (i) Amblyomma s.s. plus Rhipicephalinae (i.e. Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, Rhipicentor, and Dermacentor); and (ii) Haemaphysalis plus Bothriocroton plus Amblyomma sphenodonti. We also provide further evidence for the polyphyly of the genus Amblyomma with respect to A. sphenodonti and A. elaphense. The most likely position of A. elaphense is sister to the rest of the Metastriata; the most likely position of A. sphenodonti is sister to the genus Bothriocroton. These 2 species do not belong in the genus Amblyomma, and we propose that new genera are required for A. sphenodonti and A. elaphense.},

We studied (a) repeatability and (b) the effect of abundance and species richness of small mammals on the level of their infestation by larvae and nymphs of Ixodes ricinus (ecological generalist) and Ixodes trianguliceps (ecological specialist). We asked if tick infestation parameters are characteristic (=repeatable) for a particular host species or a particular stage of a particular tick species. We also asked how abundance and diversity of hosts affect the level of tick infestation on a particular host species. We predicted that the dilution effect (decrease in tick infestation levels with an increase of host abundance and/or species richness) will be better expressed in an ecological generalist, I. ricinus, than in an ecological specialist, I. trianguliceps. We found that (a) tick abundance, prevalence and aggregation were generally repeatable within tick species/stage; (b) tick abundance and prevalence, but not the aggregation level, were repeatable within host species; (c) the proportion of variance among samples explained by the differences between tick species and stages (as opposed to within-tick species and stage) was higher than that explained by the differences between host species (as opposed to within host species); and (d) the relationship between tick infestation parameters and host abundance and diversity revealed the dilution effect for I. ricinus but not for I. trianguliceps.},

The microhabitat choice of all life cycle stages, both unfed and engorged, of two Australian ixodid ticks, Amblyomma limbatum and Aponomma hydrosauri, were compared in the laboratory. When offered a choice between bare soil (or sand) and soil covered with litter, most ticks moved into the litter, except unfed larvae which often took refuge within crevices on the surface of exposed sand. The two species differed in the position they adopted within the litter. Ap. hydrosauri were predominately found at the interface between the soil and litter. Amb. limb\&urn were more often found higher up in the litter. There were also interspecific differences in the body orientation of ticks within the litter. All life cycle stages of Ap. hydrosuuri adopted a position with their dorsal surface facing upwards, whereas unfed stages of Amb. limbatum were more frequently found with their ventral surface facing upwards. The behaviour of each species probably represents a different compromise between two factors, maximizing host detection, and minimizing their exposure to desiccation or predation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Vectorborne diseases are major causes of death and illness worldwide. In the United States, the most common vectorborne pathogens are transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes, including those causing Lyme disease; Rocky Mountain spotted fever; and West Nile, dengue, and Zika virus diseases. This report examines trends in occurrence of nationally reportable vectorborne diseases during 2004-2016. Methods: Data reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System for 16 notifiable vectorborne diseases during 2004-2016 were analyzed; findings were tabulated by disease, vector type, location, and year. Results: A total 642,602 cases were reported. The number of annual reports of tickborne bacterial and protozoan diseases more than doubled during this period, from {\textgreater}22,000 in 2004 to {\textgreater}48,000 in 2016. Lyme disease accounted for 82\% of all tickborne disease reports during 2004-2016. The occurrence of mosquitoborne diseases was marked by virus epidemics. Transmission in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa accounted for most reports of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus diseases; West Nile virus was endemic, and periodically epidemic, in the continental United States. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Vectorborne diseases are a large and growing public health problem in the United States, characterized by geographic specificity and frequent pathogen emergence and introduction. Differences in distribution and transmission dynamics of tickborne and mosquitoborne diseases are often rooted in biologic differences of the vectors. To effectively reduce transmission and respond to outbreaks will require major national improvement of surveillance, diagnostics, reporting, and vector control, as well as new tools, including vaccines.},

Illustrations of varying quality and accuracy of these species have been published in the past; however, they have never been collectively treated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Female Australian paralysis ticks are here examined using SEM, and the first pictorial key for this group is presented along with an accurate text key.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are urban dwellers and host both Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes hexagonus. These ticks transmit several zoonotic pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia helvetica, Borrelia miyamotoi and "Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis". It is unclear to what extent hedgehogs in (sub) urban areas contribute to the presence of infected ticks in these areas, which subsequently pose a risk for acquiring a tick-borne disease. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent hedgehogs contribute to the enzootic cycle of these tick-borne pathogens, and to shed more light at the mechanisms of the transmission cycles involving hedgehogs and both ixodid tick species. METHODS: Engorged ticks from hedgehogs were collected from (sub) urban areas via rehabilitating centres in Belgium. Ticks were screened individually for presence of Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia helvetica and "Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis" using PCR-based methods. Infection rates of the different pathogens in ticks were calculated and compared to infection rates in questing ticks. RESULTS: Both Ixodes hexagonus (n = 1132) and Ixodes ricinus (n = 73) of all life stages were found on the 54 investigated hedgehogs. Only a few hedgehogs carried most of the ticks, with 6 of the 54 hedgehogs carrying more than half of all ticks (624/1205). Borrelia miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, R. helvetica and B. burgdorferi genospecies (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia bavariensis and Borrelia spielmanii) were detected in both I. hexagonus and I. ricinus. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, R. helvetica, B. afzelii, B. bavariensis and B. spielmanii were found significantly more in engorged ticks in comparison to questing I. ricinus. CONCLUSIONS: European hedgehogs seem to contribute to the spread and transmission of tick-borne pathogens in urban areas. The relatively high prevalence of B. bavariensis, B. spielmanii, B. afzelii, A. phagocytophilum and R. helvetica in engorged ticks suggests that hedgehogs contribute to their enzootic cycles in (sub) urban areas. The extent to which hedgehogs can independently maintain these agents in natural cycles, and the role of other hosts (rodents and birds) remain to be investigated.},

In Europe, LB is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spiro- chaete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, mainly trans- mitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. Recent surveys show that the overall prevalence of LB may be stabilising, but its geographical distribution is increasing. In addi- tion, much remains to be discovered about the factors affecting genospecific prevalence, transmission and virulence, although avoidance of tick bite still appears to be the most efficient preventive measure. Uniform, European-wide surveillance programmes (particularly on a local scale) and standardisation of diagnostic tests and treatments are still urgently needed, espe- cially in the light of climate change scenarios and land-use and socio-economic changes. Improved epi- demiological knowledge will also aid development of more accurate risk prediction models for LB. Studies on the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem changes on LB emergence may identify new para- digms for the prevention and control of LB and other tick-borne diseases.},

This is the first report to present combined PCR and DNA sequence evidence of infection with Lyme Borrelia spp. in human patients in the southern U.S., and to demonstrate that several B. burgdorferi sensu lato species may be associated with Lyme disease-like signs and symptoms in southern states. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest that human Lyme borreliosis occurs in Florida and Georgia, and that some cases of Lyme-like illness referred to as southern tick associated rash illness (STARI) in the southern U.S. may be attributable to previously undetected B. burgdorferi sensu lato infections.},

The incidence of this disease is increasing in many countries. Laboratory evidence of infection, mainly serology, is essential for diagnosis, except in the case of typical erythema migrans. Diagnosed cases are usually treated with antibiotics for 2-4 weeks and most patients make an uneventful recovery. No convincing evidence exists to support the use of antibiotics for longer than 4 weeks, or for the persistence of spirochaetes in adequately treated patients.

	abstract = {Rickettsia are best known as strictly intracellular vector-borne bacteria that cause mild to severe diseases in humans and other animals. Recent advances in molecular tools and biological experiments have unveiled a wide diversity of Rickettsia spp. that include species with a broad host range and some species that act as endosymbiotic associates. Molecular phylogenies of Rickettsia spp. contain some ambiguities, such as the position of R. canadensis and relationships within the spotted fever group. In the modern era of genomics, with an ever-increasing number of sequenced genomes, there is enhanced interest in the use of whole-genome sequences to understand pathogenesis and assess evolutionary relationships among rickettsial species. Rickettsia have small genomes (1.1-1.5 Mb) as a result of reductive evolution. These genomes contain split genes, gene remnants and pseudogenes that, owing to the colinearity of some rickettsial genomes, may represent different steps of the genome degradation process. Genomics reveal extreme genome reduction and massive gene loss in highly vertebrate-pathogenic Rickettsia compared to less virulent or endosymbiotic species. Information gleaned from rickettsial genomics challenges traditional concepts of pathogenesis that focused primarily on the acquisition of virulence factors. Another intriguing phenomenon about the reduced rickettsial genomes concerns the large fraction of non-coding DNA and possible functionality of these "non-coding" sequences, because of the high conservation of these regions. Despite genome streamlining, Rickettsia spp. contain gene families, selfish DNA, repeat palindromic elements and genes encoding eukaryotic-like motifs. These features participate in sequence and functional diversity and may play a crucial role in adaptation to the host cell and pathogenesis. Genome analyses have identified a large fraction of mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, suggesting the possibility of lateral gene transfer in these intracellular bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses have identified several candidates for horizontal gene acquisition among Rickettsia spp. including tra, pat2, and genes encoding for the type IV secretion system and ATP/ADP translocase that may have been acquired from bacteria living in amoebae. Gene loss, gene duplication, DNA repeats and lateral gene transfer all have shaped rickettsial genome evolution. A comprehensive analysis of the entire genome, including genes and non-coding DNA, will help to unlock the mysteries of rickettsial evolution and pathogenesis.},

All 16S rRNA gene and groESL sequences deposited in GenBank prior to 2000 and selected sequences deposited thereafter were aligned and phylogenetic trees and bootstrap values were calculated using the neighbour-joining method and compared with trees generated with maximum-probability, maximum-likelihood, majority-rule consensus and parsimony methods. Supported by bootstrap probabilities of at least 54\%, 16S rRNA gene comparisons consistently clustered to yield four distinct clades characterized roughly as Anaplasma (including the Ehrlichia phagocytophila group, Ehrlichia platys and Ehrlichia bovis) with a minimum of 96.1\% similarity, Ehrlichia (including Cowdria ruminantium) with a minimum of 97.7\% similarity, Wolbachia with a minimum of 95.6\% similarity and Neorickettsia (including Ehrlichia sennetsu and Ehrlichia risticii) with a minimum of 94.9\% similarity. Maximum similarity between clades ranged from 87.1 to 94.9\%. Insufficient differences existed among E. phagocytophila, Ehrlichia equi and the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) agent to support separate species designations, and this group was at least 98.2\% similar to any Anaplasma species. These 16S rRNA gene analyses are strongly supported by similar groESL clades, as well as biological and antigenic characteristics. It is proposed that all members of the tribes Ehrlichieae and Wolbachieae be transferred to the family Anaplasmataceae and that the tribe structure of the family Rickettsiaceae be eliminated.

By nested PCR with amplification by the universal primers and then reamplification with the specific primers described above, the expected 919-bp product was generated from the blood of the index patient and three additional patients. Blood from these four patients and two more patients with granulocytic morulae contained DNA which was amplified by nested PCR involving a combination of a universal primer and the human granulocytic ehrlichia-E. phagocytophila-E. equi-E. platys group-specific primer. This apparently vector-borne human granulocytic ehrlichia has only 92.5\% 16S rDNA homology with E. chaffeensis. Nested PCR with group-specific primers did not amplify E. chaffeensis DNA, and E. chaffeensis-specific primers did not amplify DNAs of the human granulocytic ehrlichia. Thus, six patients were shown to be infected by an Ehrlichia species never previously reported to infect humans.},

The HGE agent was quantitated by competitive PCR with blood from infected mice and with Ixodes scapularis ticks. The median infectious dose for C3H mice was 104 to 105 organisms when blood from an infected severe combined immunodeficient mouse was used as an inoculum. Uninfected larval ticks began to acquire infection from infected mice within 24 h of attachment, and the number of HGE agent organisms increased in larval ticks during feeding and after detachment of replete ticks. Molted nymphal ticks, infected as larvae, transmitted infection to mice between 40 and 48 h of attachment. Onset of feeding stimulated replication of the HGE agent within nymphal ticks. These studies suggest that replication of the HGE agent during and after feeding in larvae and during feeding in nymphs is a means by which the HGE agent overcomes inefficiencies in acquisition of infection by ticks and in tick-borne transmission to mammalian hosts.},

Larval deer ticks acquired infection by feeding upon such mice and efficiently transmitted the ehrlichiae after molting to nymphs, thereby demonstrating vector competence. The agent was detected by demonstrating Feulgen-positive inclusions in the salivary glands of the experimentally infected ticks and from field-derived adult deer ticks. White-footed mice from a field site infected laboratory-reared ticks with the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, suggesting that these rodents serve as reservoirs for ehrlichiae as well as for Lyme disease spirochetes and the piroplasm that causes human babesiosis. About 10\% of host-seeking deer ticks were infected with ehrlichiae, and of these, 20\% also contained spirochetes. Cotransmission of diverse pathogens by the aggressively human-biting deer tick may have a unique impact on public health in certain endemic sites.},

	abstract = {The presence of granulocytic ehrlichiae was demonstrated by PCR in Ixodes ricinus ticks and wild small mammals in Switzerland in two areas of endemicity for bovine ehrlichiosis. Six ticks (three females and three nymphs) (1.4\%) of 417 I. ricinus ticks collected by flagging vegetation contained ehrlichial DNA. A total of 201 small mammals from five species, wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), earth vole (Pitymys subterraneus), bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), and common shrew (Sorex araneus), were trapped. The analysis of I. ricinus ticks [corrected] collected on 116 small mammals showed that nine C. glareolus voles and two A. sylvaticus mice hosted infected tick larvae. In these rodents, granulocytic ehrlichia infection was also detected in blood, spleen, liver, and ear samples. Further examinations of 190 small mammals without ticks or with noninfected ticks showed the presence of ehrlichial DNA in spleen and other tissues from six additional C. glareolus, three A. flavicollis, and one S. araneus mammals. This study suggests that A. sylvaticus, A. flavicollis, S. araneus, and particularly C. glareolus are likely to be natural reservoirs for granulocytic ehrlichiae. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of granulocytic ehrlichiae from ticks and rodents showed a high degree of homology (99 to 100\%) with granulocytic ehrlichiae isolated from humans. In contrast, groESL heat shock operon sequence analysis showed a strong divergence (approximately 5\%) between the sequences in samples derived from rodents and those derived from samples from questing ticks or from other published ehrlichia sequences. Dual infections with granulocytic ehrlichia and Borrelia burgdorferi were found in ticks and small mammals.},

Of these, samples from 25 wood rats (34\% of those tested) and 10 (8\%) Peromyscus sp. mice were found to be seropositive, but only those from one site. PCR assays targeting the groESL heat shock operon were conducted on all seropositive specimens and a subset of seronegative blood specimens. Ehrlichial DNA was identified in 17 (68\%) of the 25 seropositive wood rat blood samples and in 1 of the 10 (10\%) Peromyscus sp. specimens. None of 40 seronegative blood samples was PCR positive. Both seropositive and PCR-positive animals were collected during each trapping period. One male tick out of 84 Ixodes pacificus adults collected was PCR positive; samples of Dermacentor occidentalis nymphs and adults were negative. Nucleotide sequences of amplicons from three wood rat blood specimens and from the single PCR-positive tick differed by one and two bases, respectively, from a sequence previously obtained from Ehrlichia equi. At one site in Sonoma County, wood rats had a concurrent high prevalence of seropositivity and PCR positivity, while other sigmodontine rodents collected at the site were only occasionally infected. We suggest that dusky-footed wood rats serve as reservoirs of granulocytic ehrlichial agents in certain areas of northern California.

DNA barcoding has been proved to be a powerful tool to identify species of arthropods, but this technique has not yet been developed for identifying ticks. Here, we screened and analyzed 1082 sequences of ticks from BOLD system and GenBank, consisting of 647 16S, 325 COI, and 110 18S. These sequences are reported in previous studies and considered to be correctly identified at the species level. Through the analyses of genetic divergences and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic relationships between the species of ticks, our results show that COI and 16S are reliable in discriminating species of ticks and the 18S could discriminate ticks at the genera level. New universal primers for 16S, 18S, and COI of ticks were designed and a DNA barcoding system for the Ixodida was developed. To assess the performance of this system, 57 specimens of ticks were collected within China. Our results show that DNA barcoding system could correctly identify the species of specimens in adult and subadult stages. This system would assist non-taxonomists to conveniently identify the species of Ixodida based on DNA sequences rather than morphological traits. However, there are still serious deficiencies in the information of 16S and COI of some species of ticks, and additional research is needed to resolve this problem.},

	volume = {7},
	abstract = {Background: The 5' region of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) is the standard marker for DNA barcoding. However, COI has proved to be of limited use in identifying some species, and for some taxa, the coding sequence is not efficiently amplified by PCR. These deficiencies lead to uncertainty as to whether COI is the most suitable barcoding fragment for species identification of ticks. Methods: In this study, we directly compared the relative effectiveness of COI, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 12S rDNA for tick species identification. A total of 307 sequences from 84 specimens representing eight tick species were acquired by PCR. Besides the 1,834 published sequences of 189 tick species from GenBank and the Barcode of Life Database, 430 unpublished sequences representing 59 tick species were also successfully screened by Bayesian analyses. Thereafter, the performance of the four DNA markers to identify tick species was evaluated by identification success rates given by these markers using nearest neighbour (NN), BLASTn, liberal tree-based or liberal tree-based (+threshold) methods. Results: Genetic divergence analyses showed that the intra-specific divergence of each marker was much lower than the inter-specific divergence. Our results indicated that the rates of correct sequence identification for all four markers (COI, 16S rDNA, ITS2, 12S rDNA) were very high ({\textgreater} 96\%) when using the NN methodology. We also found that COI was not significantly better than the other markers in terms of its rate of correct sequence identification. Overall, BLASTn and NN methods produced higher rates of correct species identification than that produced by the liberal tree-based methods (+threshold or otherwise). Conclusions: As the standard DNA barcode, COI should be the first choice for tick species identification, while 16S rDNA, ITS2, and 12S rDNA could be used when COI does not produce reliable results. Besides, NN and BLASTn are efficient methods for species identification of ticks.},

Seabirds are important reservoir hosts of some members of the Bbsl complex in the Northern Hemisphere, and some evidence suggests this may be true of penguins in the Southern Hemisphere. While the Bbsl complex has not been detected in Australia, a novel Borrelia species ('Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi') was recently sequenced from native ticks (Ixodes holocyclus and Bothriocroton concolor) parasitising echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), suggesting unidentified borreliae may be circulating amongst native wildlife and their ticks. In the present study, we investigated whether ticks parasitising little penguins (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) harbour native or introduced Borrelia bacteria. We chose this penguin species because it is heavily exploited by ticks during the breeding season, lives in close proximity to other potential reservoir hosts (including native wildlife and migratory seabirds), and is known to be infected with other tick-borne pathogens (Babesia). We screened over 230 penguin ticks (Ixodes spp.) from colonies in south-eastern Australia, and found no evidence of Borrelia DNA. The apparent absence or rarity of the bacterium in south-eastern Australia has important implications for identifying potential tick-borne pathogens in an understudied region.},

	abstract = {Determining which wildlife hosts are involved in the enzootic cycles of tick-borne diseases (TBD) enables enhanced surveillance and risk assessment of potential transmission to humans and domestic species. Currently, there is limited data to indicate which tick-borne pathogens (TBP) can infect coyotes. Additionally, limited surveillance data for white-tailed deer (WTD) in south Texas is available. The purpose of this study was to detect current infections of common TBP in coyotes and WTD in south Texas, which represents a transboundary region and common site for animal migrations across the U.S.-Mexico border. A patent pending real-time PCR assay, the TickPath layerplex test, was used to screen whole-blood samples for species from Borrelia, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Babesia genera. Conventional PCR and subsequent sequencing of positive samples confirmed the pathogen species. Of 122 coyote samples, 11/122 (9.0\%) were positive for Babesia vogeli and 1/122 (0.8\%) was positive for Borrelia turicatae. Of 245 WTD samples, 1/245 (0.4\%) was positive for Anaplasma platys, 4/245 (1.6\%) were positive for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 18/245 (7.3\%) were positive for Theileria cervi. All positive samples from both species, except for one coyote, were collected from counties located in south Texas along the United States-Mexico border. One coyote positive for B. vogeli originated from a county in northern Texas. The results from this study depicts the first known molecular detection of B. turicatae in a coyote, and demonstrates that coyotes and WTDs can potentially serve as sentinels for several zoonotic TBD as well as TBD that affect domestic animals.},

	abstract = {Objective To describe the detection of Ehrlichia platys in free-roaming dogs in Central Australia. Procedure Blood samples were collected from four dogs and examined for bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays. The three positive samples obtained were then sequenced and identification of the PCR product carried out. As a result of all three samples being identical to or closely related to part of the 16S rRNA gene of E platys, blood samples were subsequently obtained from a further 24 dogs. These samples were screened using a PCR-assay to determine the presence of Ehrlichia DNA using genus-specific primers. The positive samples obtained from the screening process were then subjected to a further PCR-assay using E platys specific primers. Results Of 28 dogs sampled, Ehrlichia DNA was detected in the blood of 13 dogs. Sequencing of the amplicons obtained indicated a high homology with the 16S rRNA gene for E platys. When the E platys-specific PCR was performed for 10 of those dogs, the 678 bp product obtained from the PCR amplification confirmed the identification as part of the 16S rRNA gene of E platys in all 10 dogs. Conclusion This study reports for the first time Ehrlichia carriage by dogs in Australia. It also indicates the usefulness of the PCR technique in rapidly and accurately identifying diseases that are otherwise difficult to detect. By using universal primers directed against bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA and sequencing analysis, the detection of potentially pathogenic Ehrlichia organisms that had not previously been found in Australia has been made possible.},

The brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato is presumed to be the vector of A. platys based on the overlap in distribution of R. sanguineus and A. platys infections, detection of A. platys DNA in both flat and engorged field-collected R. sanguineus, and the fact that dogs are primary hosts of both brown dog ticks and A. platys. However, the only study evaluating the vector competence of R. sanguineus for A. platys under controlled laboratory conditions reported an apparent inability of ticks to acquire or maintain the pathogen. In 2016, engorged female Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto ticks were collected off dogs to start a laboratory tick colony. After one generation of colony maintenance on tick-naive and pathogen-free New Zealand White rabbits, a rabbit used to feed F1 adults seroconverted to Anaplasma phagocytophilum antigen. PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing identified the presence of A. platys in both the adult ticks fed on this rabbit and their resulting F2 progenies. Retrospective testing of all previous (P and F1) life stages of this colony demonstrated that the infection originated from one field-collected A. platys-infected female whose progeny was propagated in the laboratory and produced the PCR-positive F1 adults. Over the following (F2-F4) generations, the prevalence of A. platys in this colony reached 90-100 \% indicating highly efficient transovarial and horizontal transmission, as well as transstadial maintenance, of this pathogen by R. sanguineus s.s.},

	abstract = {Interest in microbial communities, or microbiota, of blood-feeding arthropods such as ticks (order Parasitiformes, suborder Ixodida) is increasing. Studies on tick microorganisms historically emphasized pathogens of high medical or veterinary importance. Current techniques allow for simultaneous detection of pathogens of interest, non-pathogenic symbionts, like Coxiella-LE and Francisella-LE, and microorganisms of unknown pathogenic potential. While each generation of ticks begins with a maternally acquired repertoire of microorganisms, microhabitats off and on vertebrate hosts can alter the microbiome during the life cycle. Further, blood-feeding may allow for horizontal exchange of various pathogenic microbiota that may or may not also be capable of vertical transmission. Thus, the tick microbiome may be in constant flux. The geographical spread of tick vector populations has resulted in a broader appreciation of tick-borne diseases and tick-associated microorganisms. Over the last decade, next-generation sequencing technology targeting the 16S rRNA gene led to documented snapshots of bacterial communities among life stages of laboratory and field-collected ticks, ticks in various feeding states, and tick tissues. Characterizing tick bacterial communities at population and individual tissue levels may lead to identification of markers for pathogen maintenance, and thus, indicators of disease "potential" rather than disease state. Defining the role of microbiota within the tick may lead to novel control measures targeting tick-bacterial interactions. Here, we review our current understanding of microbial communities for some vectors in the family Ixodidae (hard ticks) in North America, and interpret published findings for audiences in veterinary and medical fields with an appreciation of tick-borne disease.},

The Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni (Acari: Ixodidae), transmits Rickettsia rickettsii and Anaplasma marginale to humans and cattle, respectively. In recent years, studies have shown that symbiotic organisms are involved in a number of biochemical and physiological functions. Characterizing the bacterial microbiome of D. andersoni is a pivotal step towards understanding symbiont-host interactions. FINDINGS: In this study, we have shown by high-throughput sequence analysis that the composition of endosymbionts in the midgut and salivary glands in adult ticks is dynamic over three generations. Four Proteobacteria genera, Rickettsia, Francisella, Arsenophonus, and Acinetobacter, were identified as predominant symbionts in these two tissues. Exposure to therapeutic doses of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, oxytetracycline, affected both proportions of predominant genera and significantly reduced reproductive fitness. Additionally, Acinetobacter, a free-living ubiquitous microbe, invaded the bacterial microbiome at different proportions based on antibiotic treatment status suggesting that microbiome composition may have a role in susceptibility to environmental contaminants. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterized the bacterial microbiome in D. andersoni and determined the generational variability within this tick. Furthermore, this study confirmed that microbiome manipulation is associated with tick fitness and may be a potential method for biocontrol.},

In this study, we surveyed 40,000+ manuscripts and identified those that considered wildlife hosts when studying Ixodes scapularis(Blacklegged Tick). We found that there appears to be a taxonomic bias in research on wildlife hosts and that this may be contributing to a continued lack of knowledge about potential transmission and management of Blacklegged Ticks or Lyme Disease. Collectively, these findings suggest that more information is needed on wildlife hosts and tick-host ecology, particularly that of birds, meso-mammals and reptiles.

In this study, we attempted to expand knowledge of Australian tick-borne bacterial pathogens by analyzing various tick species from the state of Queensland for potential human pathogens belonging to the Rickettsia, Coxiella and Borrelia genera. A total of 203 ticks, comprising of four genera and nine different tick species, were screened by specific qPCR assays. An overall Rickettsia qPCR positivity of 6.4\% (13/203) was detected with rickettsial DNA found in four tick species (Ixodes holocyclus, I. tasmani, Amblyomma triguttatum, and Haemaphysalis longicornis). Amplification and analysis of several rickettsial genes from rickettsial qPCR positive samples identified sequences closely related to but genetically distinct from several previously described cultured and uncultured rickettsial species in the Rickettsia spotted fever subgroup. No ticks were positive for either Coxiella or Borrelia DNA. This work suggests that a further diversity of rickettsiae remain to be described in Australian ticks with the full importance of these bacteria to human and animal health yet to be elucidated.},

Asia HEASLIP(1941) reported the isolation in Queensland of an agent from a pool said to contain some L. deliensebut he failed to identify it satisfactorily. Investigations at our Institute defined the dinical features and epidemiology of scrub typhus in north Queensland (DoHERTY, 1956; DERRICK,1961), and CARLEYet al. (1955) characterized strains isolated from patients' blood. COOKet al. (1967) isolated R. tsutsugamushi from small mammals, and DOMROW(1967) detailed the distribution of their mites. Of the sites sampled by Cook et al., Mossman was selected for further attempts to isolate R. tsutsugamushi from L. deliense.A subsidiary study was undertaken at Cooktown. Both localities are in north Queensland. Queensland tick typhus was first recognized at Atherton in north Queensland (ANDREWet al., 1946; BRODY, 1946) and cases have since been diagnosed over much of coastal Queensland (STREETONet al., 1948; POPE,1955; KNYVETTand SANDARS,1964). Infection has generally been associated with a history of a bite from the scrub tick (Ixodes holocyclus), but previous attempts to isolate Rickettsia australis from this tick have been unsuccessful (FENNER,1946; COOKand CAMPBELL,1965). Thus, when cases in soldiers from the Jungle Training Centre, Canungra, S.E. Queensland, were identified serologically at the Laboratory of Microbiology and Pathology, Brisbane, collections aimed at identifying the vector were made there. Consequently, we can now report the first isolations of R. tsutsugamushi and R. australis from their suspected vectors in Australia},

We detected several Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) genospecies (B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. lusitaniae, B. valaisiana) in I. ricinus and skin biopsies. The most common genospecies found in I. ricinus was B. valaisiana, while it was B. lusitaniae in tissues. Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae (Rickettsia monacensis, R. slovaca and R. raoultii) infected I. ricinus, D. marginatus and rodent tissues. Rickettsia slovaca was the Rickettsia species most frequently found in our samples. Coinfections by B. burgdorferi s.l. and SFG rickettsiae indicate an overlap of transmission cycles and potential risk for humans to be infected by multiple pathogens, resulting in more severe symptoms. The findings of B. lusitaniae and R. slovaca in bank voles, and of B. valaisiana in small rodents, open new questions about host-pathogen interactions. In addition, our results highlight the importance of small rodents as data sources for studying tick-borne pathogens.},

	abstract = {Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been used for a wide range of epidemiological and surveillance studies. Here, we used amplicon-based NGS to species identify Rickettsia and their arthropod hosts from entomological surveillance. Methods: During 2015-2016, we screened 1825 samples of rodents and ectoparasites collected from rodents and domestic mammals (dog, cat, and cattle) across Thailand for Rickettsia. The citrate synthase gene was amplified to identify Rickettsia to species, while the Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and subunit II (COII) genes were used as target genes for ectoparasite identification. All target gene amplicons were pooled for library preparation and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq platform. Result: The highest percentage of Rickettsia DNA was observed in fleas collected from domestic animals (56\%) predominantly dogs. Only a few samples of ticks from domestic animals, rodent fleas, and rodent tissue were positive for Rickettisia DNA. NGS based characterization of Rickettsia by host identified Rickettsia asembonensis as the most common bacteria in positive fleas collected from dogs (83.2\%) while "Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis" was detected in only 16.8\% of Rickettsia positive dog fleas. Sequence analysis of COI and COII revealed that almost all fleas collected from dogs were Ctenocephalides felis orientis. Other Rickettsia species were detected by NGS including Rickettsia heilongjiangensis from two Haemaphysalis hystricis ticks, and Rickettsia typhi in two rodent tissue samples. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility of NGS for high-throughput sequencing in the species characterization/identification of bacteria and ectoparasite for entomological surveillance of rickettsiae. A high percentage of C. f. orientis are positive for R. asembonensis. In addition, our findings indicate there is a risk of tick-borne Spotted Fever Group rickettsiosis, and flea-borne murine typhus transmission in Tak and Phangnga provinces of Thailand.},

Patients developed characteristic manifestations of severe disease due to E. chaffeen- sis, including marked thrombocytopenia, pulmonary insufficiency, and encephalopathy. Primary isolation was achieved in DH82 cells; the Jax and St. Vincent isolates were detected within 19 and 8 days postinoculation, respectively. The isolates were characterized by molecular evaluation of the 16S rRNA gene, the groESL heat shock operon, a 120-kDa immunodominant protein gene, and an incompletely characterized repetitive-motif sequence (variable-length PCR target [VLPT]). The sequences were compared with those of the corresponding molecular regions in the type isolate (Arkansas). St. Vincent contained one fewer repeat unit in both the 120-kDa protein gene and the VLPT compared with corresponding sequences of the Jax and Arkansas isolates. 16S rRNA gene sequences from the two new isolates had 100\% identity to the corresponding sequences of the 91HE17 and Sapulpa isolates of E. chaffeensis, and to the corrected 16S rRNA gene sequence of the Arkansas isolate. The Jax isolate grew more slowly than the St. Vincent isolate in DH82 cells, and both of the new isolates grew more slowly than the extensively passaged Arkansas isolate. Although specific associations between ehrlichial pathogenicity and genotype were not identified from these comparisons, recovery of this organism from a spectrum of clinical presentations remains an integral step in understanding mechanisms of disease caused by E. chaffeensis.},

Unfortunately, amplification of nonbacterial DNA can result in a masking of bacterial populations in DGGE profiles. To surmount this problem, we developed two new primer sets for specific amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA in wine fermentation samples without amplification of eukaryotic DNA. One primer set, termed WLAB1 and WLAB2, amplified lactic acid bacteria, while another, termed WBAC1 and WBAC2, amplified both lactic acid bacterial and acetic acid bacterial populations found in wine. Primer specificity and efficacy were examined with DNA isolated from numerous bacterial, yeast, and fungal species commonly found in wine and must samples. Importantly, both primer sets effectively distinguished bacterial species in wine containing mixtures of yeast and bacteria.},

One Health 8:100102, 2019]. The dromedary camels remained the only known animal reservoir for this virus. Several aspects of the transmission cycle of the virus between animals, including arthropod-borne infection, is still largely unknown. The main objective of the current work was to study the possibility of MERS-CoV transmission through some arthropod vectors, particularly the hard ticks. To achieve this objective, we identified a positive MERS-CoV dromedary camel herd using the commercial available real-time PCR kits. We collected some arthropods, particularly the ticks from these positive animals as well as from the animal habitats. We tested these arthropods for the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNAs. Results Our results showing the absence of any detectable MERS-CoV-RNAs in these arthropods despite these animals were actively shedding the virus in their nasal secretions. Our results are confirming for the first the failure of detection of the MERS-CoV in ticks infesting dromedary camels. Failure of the detection of MERS-CoV in ticks infesting positive naturally infected MERS-CoV camels is strongly suggesting that ticks do not play roles in the transmission of the virus among the animals and close contact humans.},

Molecular diagnosis is based on the analysis and demonstration of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used for the detection and localization of nucleotide sequences in various samples while preserving cell integrity. For more than 30 years, FISH methods have in constant evolution with the development of rRNA-targeted probes and synthetic molecules, such as PNA, which have contributed to the development of this technique in various fields by research and diagnostic laboratories. We describe here a panel of infectious diseases due to intracellular bacteria for which FISH diagnosis has proven its effectiveness. FISH techniques were applied in cases of blood-culture-negative endocarditis, respiratory infections, gastrointestinal diseases, mycobacterial infections, highly pathogenic microorganisms and other fastidious bacteria such as spirochetes. FISH has been proven to be applicable to various samples and for diverse infectious diseases, it can be used as a complementary tool for the diagnosis of infectious diseases by intracellular and fastidious bacteria.},

Knowledge of the geographic distribution and prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in Wisconsin is important information as a baseline for future comparisons. Reported human cases between 2009 and 2015 were identified using the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) and mapped by county of residence. Vector surveillance was established using ticks collected from animals by partners, including veterinary medical clinics, domestic animal shelters, and wildlife rehabilitation centers from 40 Wisconsin counties. A total of 1835 Ixodes scapularis tick specimens (larvae, nymphs, and adults) were collected from 18 different domestic and wildlife species from July 2011 to November 2015. An additional 1136 nymphs were collected by drag sampling at 23 locations in 19 counties in 2015. A real-time PCR assay that detects and distinguishes several Ehrlichia species, including a pathogenic Ehrlichia muris-like agent (EMLA), and A. phagocytophilum was performed on adult and nymphal ticks. A total of 757 I. scapularis ticks (predominately adults) were tested from animal collections, with 67 (8.9\%) individuals positive for A. phagocytophilum and 22 (2.9\%) positive for EMLA DNA. Of the 1150 questing nymphs, 62 (5.4\%) were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 10 (0.9\%) were positive for EMLA DNA. Specimens of I. scapularis that were positive for A. phagocytophilum were found in 27 of the 33 counties surveyed. Specimens that were positive for EMLA were less common and were found in nine counties. This study provides the first statewide survey of I. scapularis ticks for these pathogens and indicates that the risk of human exposure is widely distributed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Characterizing microbial communities via next-generation sequencing is subject to a number of pitfalls involving sample processing. The observed community composition can be a severe distortion of the quantities of bacteria actually present in the microbiome, hampering analysis and threatening the validity of conclusions from metagenomic studies. We introduce an experimental protocol using mock communities for quantifying and characterizing bias introduced in the sample processing pipeline. We used 80 bacterial mock communities comprised of prescribed proportions of cells from seven vaginally-relevant bacterial strains to assess the bias introduced in the sample processing pipeline. We created two additional sets of 80 mock communities by mixing prescribed quantities of DNA and PCR product to quantify the relative contribution to bias of (1) DNA extraction, (2) PCR amplification, and (3) sequencing and taxonomic classification for particular choices of protocols for each step. We developed models to predict the "true" composition of environmental samples based on the observed proportions, and applied them to a set of clinical vaginal samples from a single subject during four visits. RESULTS: We observed that using different DNA extraction kits can produce dramatically different results but bias is introduced regardless of the choice of kit. We observed error rates from bias of over 85\% in some samples, while technical variation was very low at less than 5\% for most bacteria. The effects of DNA extraction and PCR amplification for our protocols were much larger than those due to sequencing and classification. The processing steps affected different bacteria in different ways, resulting in amplified and suppressed observed proportions of a community. When predictive models were applied to clinical samples from a subject, the predicted microbiome profiles were better reflections of the physiology and diagnosis of the subject at the visits than the observed community compositions. CONCLUSIONS: Bias in 16S studies due to DNA extraction and PCR amplification will continue to require attention despite further advances in sequencing technology. Analysis of mock communities can help assess bias and facilitate the interpretation of results from environmental samples.},

	title = {Behind {Taxonomic} {Variability}: {The} {Functional} {Redundancy} in the {Tick} {Microbiome}},
	abstract = {The taxonomic composition and diversity of tick midgut microbiota have been extensively studied in different species of the genera Rhipicephalus, Ixodes, Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Dermacentor, Argas and Ornithodoros, while the functional significance of bacterial diversity has been proportionally less explored. In this study, we used previously published 16S amplicon sequence data sets from three Ixodes scapularis cohorts, two of uninfected nymphs, and one of larvae experimentally infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, to test the functional redundancy of the tick microbiome. We predicted the metabolic profiling of each sample using the state-of-the-art metagenomics tool PICRUSt2. The results showed that the microbiomes of all I. scapularis samples share only 80 taxa (24.6\%, total 324), while out of the 342 metabolic pathways predicted, 82.7\%, were shared by all the ticks. Borrelia-infected larvae lack 15.4\% of pathways found in the microbiome of uninfected nymphs. Taxa contribution analysis showed that the functional microbiome of uninfected ticks was highly redundant, with, in some cases, up to 198 bacterial taxa contributing to a single pathway. However, Borrelia-infected larvae had a smaller redundancy with 6.7\% of pathways provided by more than 100 genera, while 15.7-19.2\% of pathways were provided by more than 100 genera in the two cohorts of uninfected ticks. In addition, we compared the functional profiles of three microbial communities from each data set, identified through a network-based approach, and we observed functional similarity between them. Based on the functional redundancy and functional similarity of the microbiome of ticks in different developmental stages and infection status, we concluded that the tick gut microbiota is a self-regulating community of very diverse bacteria contributing to a defined set of metabolic pathways and functions with yet unexplored relevance for tick fitness and/or bacterial community stability. We propose a change of focus in which the tick microbiome must be analyzed in all dimensions, highlighting their functional traits, instead of the conventional taxonomic profiling.},

	abstract = {Background: Arthropod-borne diseases remain a major health-threat for humans and animals worldwide. To estimate the distribution of pathogenic agents and especially Bartonella spp., we conducted tick microbiome analysis and determination of the infection status of wild animals, pets and pet owners in the state of Hesse, Germany. Results: In total, 189 engorged ticks collected from 163 animals were tested. Selected ticks were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and confirmatory PCRs, blood specimens of 48 wild animals were analyzed by PCR to confirm pathogen presence and sera of 54 dogs, one cat and 11 dog owners were analyzed by serology. Bartonella spp. were detected in 9.5\% of all ticks and in the blood of 17 roe deer. Further data reveal the presence of the human and animal pathogenic species of genera in the family Spirochaetaceae (including Borrelia miyamotoi and Borrelia garinii), Bartonella spp. (mainly Bartonella schoenbuchensis), Rickettsia helvetica, Francisella tularensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks. Co-infections with species of several genera were detected in nine ticks. One dog and five dog owners were seropositive for anti-Bartonella henselae-antibodies and one dog had antibodies against Rickettsia conorii. Conclusions: This study provides a snapshot of pathogens circulating in ticks in central Germany. A broad range of tick-borne pathogens are present in ticks, and especially in wild animals, with possible implications for animal and human health. However, a low incidence of Bartonella spp., especially Bartonella henselae, was detected. The high number of various detected pathogens suggests that ticks might serve as an excellent sentinel to detect and monitor zoonotic human pathogens.},

In the present study, we surveyed the microbial communities harboured by human-bit- ing ticks from across Australia to identify bacteria that may contribute to this syndrome. Universal PCR primers were used to amplify the V1-2 hyper-variable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in DNA samples from individual Ixodes holocyclus (n = 279), Amblyomma triguttatum (n = 167), Haemaphysalis bancrofti (n = 7), and H. longicornis (n = 7) ticks. The 16S amplicons were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform and analysed in USEARCH, QIIME, and BLAST to assign genus and species-level taxonomies. Nested PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the NGS data and further analyse novel findings. All 460 ticks were negative for Borrelia spp. by both NGS and nested PCR analy- sis. Two novel "Candidatus Neoehrlichia" spp. were identified in 12.9\% of I. holocyclus ticks. A novel Anaplasma sp. was identified in 1.8\% of A. triguttatum ticks, and a novel Ehrli- chia sp. was identified in both A. triguttatum (1.2\%) ticks and a single I. holocyclus (0.6\%) tick. Further phylogenetic analysis of novel "Ca. Neoehrlichia", Anaplasma and Ehrlichia based on 1,265 bp 16S rRNA gene sequences suggests that these are new species.

PCR was performed using Bartonella genus-specific primers amplifying segments of the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer and citrate synthase (gltA) and beta subunit of the RNA polymerase (rpoB) genes. PCR products were sequenced and compared online with sequences stored in the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the United States of America. RESULTS: DNA sequences matching Bartonella coopersplainsensis and B. henselae were detected in samples from 22/143 (15.4\%) and 3/143 (2.1\%) rats, respectively. Cooccurrence of B. coopersplainsensis and B. henselae sequences was observed in the sample from one rat. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Gramnegative fastidious bacteria belonging to the genus Bartonella are associated with a range of human diseases. Rodents play an important role as reservoirs of a broad range of Bartonella species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular detection of Bartonella spp. DNA in rodents from New Zealand, and the first identification of B. henselae DNA in rats, worldwide. Whereas the public health significance of B. coopersplainsensis remains undefined, B. henselae is the agent of cat scratch disease, and the presence of this bacterium in rats may have public health implications. Our results are preliminary and additional analyses of larger samples, preferably by bacterial culture, would provide more information on the prevalence and diversity of Bartonella spp., in particular B. henselae, in rats.},

	abstract = {Bartonella are fastidious, Gram-negative, aerobic bacilli belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria group. In the last ten years, the discovery of new Bartonella species from a variety of mammalian hosts, arthropod vectors and geographical areas has increased. More than 20 species of Bartonella have been identified, of which approximately thirteen are associated with disease in humans and animals. Recently, four novel species of Bartonella were isolated from mammalian hosts in Australia: Bartonella australis from eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) and Bartonella rattaustraliani, Bartonella queenslandensis and Bartonella coopersplainsensis from rodents. Bartonella-like organisms have also been detected from Ixodes tasmani ticks collected from koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). However, very little is known about Bartonella spp. in other marsupials in Australia. We report the identification of a novel Bartonella species detected from fleas (Acanthopsylla jordani) and ticks (Ixodes antechini) collected from a small carnivorous marsupial, Antechinus flavipes (Mardos or Yellow-footed antechinus) in the southwest of Western Australia. New nested-PCRs targeting the gltA gene and the ribosomal ITS region were developed as part of the present study. DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA, gltA, ftsZ and rpoB genes and the ribosomal ITS region revealed that this detection is a distinct Bartonella species and is related to B. australis isolated from kangaroos. This is the first report of two different possible arthropod vectors in Australia (ticks and fleas) being infected with the same species of Bartonella. We propose the name Candidatus Bartonella antechini n. sp. for the recently characterized organism.},

The diseases are widely reported amongst international travellers returning from most sub-Saharan Africa with fever, yet their importance in local populations largely remains unknown. Although this has started to change and recently there have been increasing reports of the diseases in livestock, ticks and humans in Kenya, they have not been investigated in wildlife. We examined the presence, prevalence and species of Rickettsia present in wildlife in two regions of Kenya with a unique human-wildlife-livestock interface. For this purpose, 79 wild animals in Laikipia County and 73 in Maasai Mara National Reserve were sampled. DNA extracted from blood was tested using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the intergenic spacer rpmE-tRNAfMet and the citrate synthase-encoding gene gltA. Rickettsial DNA was detected in 2 of the 79 (2.5\%) animals in Laikipia and 4 of the 73 (5.5\%) in Maasai Mara. The PCR-positive amplicons of the gltA gene were sequenced to determine the detected Rickettsia species. This revealed Rickettsia sibirica in a Topi (Damaliscus lunatus ssp. jimela). This is the first report of spotted fever group rickettsioses in wildlife and the first to report R. sibirica in Kenya. The finding demonstrates the potential role of wild animals in the circulation of the diseases.},

One hypothesis was that raw meat diets containing reservoir species may provide a source of C. burnetii transmission. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether C. burnetii DNA was present in raw meat sold exclusively for companion animal consumption. The sample population consisted of raw meat packages (n = 58) of primarily kangaroo origin, with three to four aliquots (50-120 mg) randomly selected from each package. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole tissue in each of these aliquots using a modified protocol. Three quantitative PCR assays were used for the detection of C. burnetii targeting the IS1111 gene, the heat shock operon htpAB and the C. burnetii outer membrane protein-coding gene, com1. Coxiella burnetii DNA was detected in 25/58 samples (43\%) using the IS1111, htpAB and/or com1 PCR assays and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All samples amplifying a product in the com1 assay also amplified a product in the htpAB and IS1111 assays. A total of 17/58 (29\%) packets were positive with all three genes, 4/58 (7\%) were positive with two genes (IS1111 and htpAB) and 4/58 (7\%) were positive with the IS1111 gene only. Coxiella burnetii DNA was five times more likely to be found in offal than skeletal muscle meat samples. All meat samples in which C. burnetii DNA was found were from kangaroo tissues, while samples labelled as non-kangaroo meat (n = 4) were negative. Multi-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) identified three different genotypes of C. burnetii that have all been identified previously from Australian human clinical Q fever cases. Further investigations are required to determine the potential role of certain raw meats in the transmission of C. burnetii to cats and humans.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Background: To date, little has been documented about microorganisms harboured within Australian native ticks or their pathogenic potential. Recently, a Borrelia sp. related to the Relapsing Fever (RF) group was identified in a single tick removed from a wild echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus). The present study investigated the presence of Borrelia in 97 Bothriocroton concolor ticks parasitizing echidnas in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, Australia, using nested PCR with Borrelia-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA (16S) and flaB genes. Results: Borrelia-specific PCR assays confirmed the presence of a novel Borrelia sp. related to the RF and reptile-associated (REP) spirochaetes in 38 (39 \%) B. concolor ticks. This novel Borrelia sp. was identified in 41 \% of the B. concolor ticks in Queensland and New South Wales, but not in any ticks from Victoria. The resulting flaB sequences (407 bp) were 88 and 86 \% similar to the flaB sequences from Borrelia turcica and Borrelia hermsii, respectively. Of the ticks confirmed as Borrelia-positive following the flaB assay, 28 were positive with the 16S assay. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S sequences (1097 bp) suggests that these sequences belong to a novel Borrelia sp., which forms a unique monophyletic clade that is similar to, but distinct from, RF Borrelia spp. and REP-associated Borrelia spp. Conclusions: We conclude that the novel Borrelia sp. identified in this study does not belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) complex, and that the phylogenetic analysis of the partial 16S gene sequences suggests it forms a unique monophyletic cluster in the genus Borrelia, potentially forming a fourth major group in this genus associated with monotremes in Australia. However, a thorough molecular characterisation will be required to confirm the phylogenetic position of this unique Borrelia sp. The zoonotic potential and pathogenic consequences of this novel Borrelia sp. are unknown at the current time. Keywords: Tick-borne disease, Bothriocroton concolor, Borrelia, Echidna, Australia},

	abstract = {Insight into the composition and function of the tick microbiome has expanded considerably in recent years. Thus far, tick microbiome studies have focused on species and life stages that are responsible for transmitting disease. In this study we conducted extensive field sampling of six tick species in the far-western United States to comparatively examine the microbial composition of sympatric tick species: Ixodes pacificus, Ixodes angustus, Dermacentor variabilis, Dermacentor occidentalis, Dermacentor albipictus, and Haemaphysalis leporispalustris. These species represent both common vectors of disease and species that rarely encounter humans, exhibiting a range of host preferences and natural history. We found significant differences in microbial species diversity and composition by tick species and life stage. The microbiome of most species examined were dominated by a few primary endosymbionts. Across all species, the relative abundance of these endosymbionts increased with life stage while species richness and diversity decreased with development. Only one species, I. angustus, did not show the presence of a single dominant microbial species indicating the unique physiology of this species or its interaction with the surrounding environment. Tick species that specialize in a small number of host species or habitat ranges exhibited lower microbiome diversity, suggesting that exposure to environmental conditions or host blood meal diversity can affect the tick microbiome which in turn may affect pathogen transmission. These findings reveal important associations between ticks and their microbial community and improve our understanding of the function of non-pathogenic microbiomes in tick physiology and pathogen transmission.},

Thus, understanding the relationship between host and vector microbiomes is of importance. In this study, we investigated the bacterial community composition, diversity and assembly of the flea (Rhadinopsylla dahurica vicina), torsalo (Hypoderma curzonial), and the blood and gut of their shared pika host, Ochotona curzoniae. Bartonella, Sphingomonas and Bradyrhizobium were enriched in blood, while Wolbachia and Fusobacterium were more abundant in fleas and torsaloes. Most of potential pathogenic microbes (belonging to Fusobacterium, Rickettsia, Kingella, Porphyromonas, Bartonella and Mycoplasma) were present in the blood of pikas and their vectors. Blood communities were more similar to those from fleas than other sample types and were independent of host factors or geographical sites. Notably, blood microbes originate mainly from fleas rather than gut or torsaloes. Interestingly, the community assembly of blood, fleas or torsaloes was primarily governed by stochastic processes, while the gut microbiome was determined by deterministic processes. Ecological drift plays a dominant role in the assembly of blood and flea microbiomes. These results reflect the difficulty for predicting and regulating the microbial ecology of fleas for the prevention of potential microbiome-associated diseases.},

	title = {Quantifying dilution and amplification in a community of hosts for tick-borne pathogens},
	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Recent controversy over whether biodiversity reduces disease risk (dilution effect) has focused on the ecology of Lyme disease, a tick-borne zoonosis. A criticism of the dilution effect is that increasing host species richness might amplify disease risk, assum- ing that total host abundance, and therefore feeding opportunities for ticks, increase with species richness. In contrast, a dilution effect is expected when poor quality hosts for ticks and pathogens (dilution hosts) divert tick blood meals away from competent hosts. Even if host densities are additive, the relationship between host density and tick encounters can be nonlinear if the number of ticks that encounter a host is a saturating function of host density, which occurs if ticks aggregate on the remaining hosts rather than failing to find a host before death. Both dilution and amplification are theoretical possibilities, and assessing which is more prevalent required detailed analyses of empirical systems. We used field data to explore the degree of tick redistribution onto fewer individuals with variation in intraspecific host density and novel data-driven models for tick dynamics to determine how changes in vertebrate community composition influence the density of nymphs infected with the Lyme bacterium. To be conservative, we allowed total host density to increase additively with species richness. Our long-term field studies found that larval and nymphal ticks redistribute onto fewer individuals as host densities decline, that a large proportion of nymphs and adults find hosts, and that mice and chipmunks feed a large proportion of nymphs. White-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, short-tailed shrews, and masked shrews were important amplification hosts that greatly increased the density of infected nymphs. Gray squirrels and Virginia opossums were important dilution hosts. Removing these two species increased the maximum number of larvae attached to amplification hosts by 57\%. Raccoons and birds were minor dilution hosts under some conditions. Even under the assumption of additive community assembly, some species are likely to reduce the density of infected nymphs as diversity increases. If the assumption of additivity is relaxed, then species that reduce the density of small mammals through predation or competition might substantially reduce disease risk.},

The enzootic cycle of B. microti, endemic in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions, has been well characterised. In the western United States, however, the natural reservoir host and tick vector have not been identified for B. duncani, greatly impeding efforts to understand and manage this zoonotic disease. Two and a half decades after B. duncani was first described in a human patient in Washington State, USA, we provide evidence that the enzootic tick vector is the winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, and the reservoir host is likely the mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus. The broad, overlapping ranges of these two species covers a large portion of far-western North America, and is consistent with confirmed cases of B. duncani in the far-western United States.},

Serologic and infection status was also analyzed for 327 roe deer livetrapped in two fenced forest areas over 5 yr (2004-08). For two consecutive years during this period, 92 and 94\%of the deer in these closed populations were antibody-positive for B. divergens. Babesia spp. were isolated in autologous red blood cell culture for 131 of the trapped animals (40\%). Molecular typing was done on 76 isolates with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods targeted at the 18S ribosomal subunit gene (18 isolates) and the Bd37 gene coding for a merozoiite surface antigen implicated in a protective response (60 isolates). Results indicated continuous cocirculation of B. capreoli and B. venatorum in both forests and possible coinfection of animals with both species. No infection with B. divergens was detected. Fifteen isolates were confirmed to be B. capreoli by sequencing part of the 18S rRNA gene. Using PCR detection of the Bd37 gene, all nine isolates of B. venatorum in this study were negative, whereas the 15 confirmed and 50 putative B. capreoli isolates showed very variable restriction profiles, distinct from those known for Bd37 in B. divergens. Two isolates showed conflicting results, suggestive of mixed infection.},

	abstract = {Due to recent establishment of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, in southeastern Canada, tick-borne zoonoses (Lyme disease, human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis) are of growing concern for public health. Using white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) culled in southwestern Quebec during 2007-2008, we investigated whether hunter-killed deer could act as sentinels for early establishing tick populations and for tick-borne pathogens. Accounting for environmental characteristics of culling sites, and age and sex of deer, we investigated whether their tick infestation levels could identify locations of known tick populations detected in active surveillance, presumed tick populations detected by passive surveillance, or both. We also used spatial cluster analyses to identify spatial patterns of tick infestation and occurrence of tick-borne zoonoses infection in ticks collected from the deer. Adult ticks were found on 15\% of the 583 deer examined. Adult male deer had the greatest number (approximately 90\%) of adult ticks. Overall, 3, 15, and 0\% of the ticks collected were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti, respectively. Our statistical analyses suggest that sex and age of deer, temperature, precipitation, and an index of tick dispersion by migratory birds were significantly associated with tick infestation levels. Cluster analysis identified significant clusters of deer carrying ticks PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum, and for deer carrying two or more I. scapularis. Our study suggests that hunter-killed deer may be effective as sentinels for emerging areas of tick-borne anaplasmosis. They may have limited use as sentinels for early emerging I. scapularis tick populations and emerging Lyme disease risk.},

In this arthropod, M. mitochondrii is observed in the oocytes and in other cells of the ovary, where the symbiont is present in the cell cytoplasm and inside the mitochondria. No studies have so far investigated whether M. mitochondrii is present in the salivary glands of the tick and whether it is transmitted to vertebrates during the tick blood meal. To address the above issues, we developed a recombinant antigen of M. mitochondrii (to screen human sera) and antibodies against this antigen (for the staining of the symbiont). Using these reagents we show that (i) M. mitochondrii is present in the salivary glands of I. ricinus and that (ii) seropositivity against M. mitochondrii is highly prevalent in humans parasitized by I. ricinus (58\%), while it is very low in healthy individuals (1.2\%). These results provide evidence that M. mitochondrii is released with the tick saliva and raise the possibility that M. mitochondrii is infectious to vertebrates. Besides this, our study indicates that M. mitochondrii should be regarded as a package of antigens inoculated into the human host during the tick bite. This implies that the immunology of the response toward the saliva of I. ricinus is to be reconsidered on the basis of potential effects of M. mitochondrii and poses the basis for the development of novel markers for investigating the exposure of humans and animals to this tick species.},

The presumptive endosymbiont of Ixodes ricinus, 'Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii', has a unique ability to invade mitochondria within tick ovarian cells and is transovarially transmitted with 100\% efficiency. A closely related bacterium, provisionally named Montezuma (now 'Candidatus Lariskella arthropodarum'), was isolated from the Ixodes persulcatus ticks and human blood in 2004 as well as from Ixodes pavlovskyi in 2015. These microorganisms belong to the family 'Candidatus Midichloriaceae fam. nov.' and were detected not only in tick salivary glands, but also in animal blood. Nevertheless, the relative importance of vertical and horizontal routes for their transmission or maintenance in natural tick populations remains unclear. We analyzed the prevalence of L. arthropodarum and M. mitochondrii in two sympatric zones, where I. persulcatus/I. ricinus and I. persulcatus/I. pavlovskyi cohabit and produce interspecific hybrids. A specificity of the associations of L. arthropodarum with I. persulcatus (100\%) and M. mitochondrii with I. ricinus (96.2\%) was observed in the sympatric zone in Estonia, possibly showing poor contribution of the horizontal route to the overall prevalence of endosymbionts. L. arthropodarum was observed probably multiplying in I. pavlovskyi and also subjected to transovarial transmission, but much less efficiently compared to I. persulcatus. We revealed two new genetic variants of the rrl-rrf intergenic spacer of L. arthropodarum isolated from I. pavlovskyi ticks that possibly could indicate an ongoing process of adaptation of the microorganism to a new host species.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Late Quaternary extinctions of megafauna (defined as animal species {\textgreater}44.5 kg) reduced the dispersal of seeds and nutrients, and likely also microbes and parasites. Here we use body-mass based scaling and range maps for extinct and extant mammal species to show that these extinctions led to an almost seven-fold reduction in the movement of gut-transported microbes, such as Escherichia coli (3.3 km 2 /day to 0.5 km 2 /day). Similarly, the extinctions led to a seven-fold reduction in the mean home ranges of vector-borne pathogens (7.8 km 2 to 1.1 km 2 ). We created an individual-based model where maximum aggregated microbial mutations increased 4-fold after 20,000 years following an order of magnitude decrease in home range. We hypothesize that pathogen speciation and hence endemism increased with isolation, as global dispersal distances decreased through a mechanism similar to the theory of island biogeography. To investigate if such an effect could be found, we analysed where 145 zoonotic diseases have emerged in human populations and found significant improvement (increasing variance explained by 8\%) when we included quantitative estimates of reduced dispersal of ectoparasites and fecal pathogens. These results suggest that megafauna extinctions reduced pathogen dispersal, which increased the development of zoonotic pathogens moving into human populations.},

	abstract = {Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods and transmit a variety of medically important viral, bacterial, protozoan pathogens to animals and humans. Ticks also harbor a diverse community of microbes linked to their biological processes, such as hematophagy, and hence affect vector competence. The interactions between bacterial and/or protozoan pathogens and the tick microbiome is a black-box, and therefore we tested the hypothesis that the presence of a protozoan or bacterial pathogen will alter the microbial composition within a tick. Hence, this study was designed to define the microbial composition of two tick species, Hyalomma (H.) anatolicum and Rhipicephalus (R.) microplus. We used a combination of PCR based pathogen (Anaplasma marginale and Theileria species) and symbiont (Wolbachia species) identification followed by metagenomic sequencing and comparison of the microbial communities in PCR positive and negative ticks. A total of 1786 operational taxonomic units was identified representing 25 phyla, 50 classes, and 342 genera. The phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota were the most represented bacteria group. Alpha and beta diversity were not significantly affected in the presence or absence of Theileria sp. and A. marginale as see with H. anatolicum ticks. Interestingly, bacterial communities were significantly reduced in Theileria sp. infected R. microplus ticks, while also exhibiting a significant reduction in microbial richness and evenness. Putting these observations together, we referred to the effect the presence of Theileria sp. has on R. microplus a "pathogen-induced dysbiosis". We also identify the presence of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria from the microbiome of both H. anatolicum and R. microplus ticks. These findings support the presence of a "pathogen-induced dysbiosis" within the tick and further validation experiments are required to investigate how they are important in the vector competence of ticks. Understanding the mechanism of "pathogen-induced dysbiosis" on tick microbial composition may aid the discovery of intervention strategies for the control of emerging tick-borne infections.},

We performed 16S rRNA bacterial surveys on female I. scapularis from Alberta that were previously qPCR-tested in a Lyme disease surveillance program.

The 16S studies also provided a profile of associated bacteria that showed the microbiome of I. scapularis in Alberta was similar to other areas of North America. Ticks that were qPCR-positive for Borrelia had significantly greater bacterial diversity than Borrelia-negative ticks, on the basis of generalized linear model testing. This study adds value to ongoing tick surveillance and is a foundation for deeper understanding of tick microbial ecology and disease transmission in a region where I. scapularis range expansion, induced by climate and land use changes, is likely to have increasing public health implications.},

We used a single multiplex quantitative PCR assay to detect tickborne pathogens in 1901 tick samples. At the state level, we found that Bo. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum infection rates of adults (42.4\%, 11.1\%) were nearly double that of nymphs (26.9\%, 6.7\%), whereas B. microti prevalence was similar for both adults (6.5\%) and nymphs (5.2\%). Spatially, we found an uneven distribution of both tick activity and pathogen prevalence, with both increasing on a north to south gradient.

Ectoparasite diversity on brown antechinuses was particularly high for a small mammal: 18 species of ectoparasites were recorded, including one undescribed species of mite. Ectoparasite infestation varied between study sites and changed seasonally. Variation between sites was related to habitat and environmental parameters, and the highest ectoparasite infestations were encountered in the coolest habitat with greatest depth of leaf litter. Host population densities varied only slightly between sites, and host density was not considered to be a primary factor influencing ectoparasite infestation. This is the first study to provide a host record of ectoparasites of Antechinus stuartii sensu stricto.},

Among the mainland subspecies of O. robustus, 52 species of helminths were encountered in O. r. robustus, compared with 30 species in O. r. woodwardi and 35 species in O. r. erubescens. Of the parasite species encountered, only 17 were specific to O. robustus, the remaining being shared with sympatric host species. Host-specific species or species occurring in O. robustus at a high prevalence can be classified as follows: widely distributed; restricted to northern Australia; restricted to the northern wallaroo, O. r. woodwardi; found only in the euro, O. r. erubescens; found essentially along the eastern coast of Australia, primarily in O. r. robustus; and species with highly limited regional distributions. The data currently available suggest that the acquisition of a significant number of parasites is due to co-grazing with other macropodids, while subspeciation in wallaroos as well as climatic variables may have influenced the diversification of the parasite fauna.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is of critical value to human societies, but recent evidence that biodiversity may mitigate infectious-disease risk has sparked controversy among researchers. The majority of work on this topic has focused on direct assessments of the relationship between biodiversity and endemic-pathogen prevalence, without disentangling intervening mechanisms; thus study outcomes often differ, fuelling more debate. Here, we suggest two critical changes to the approach researchers take to understanding relationships between infectious disease, both endemic and emerging, and biodiversity that may help clarify sources of controversy. First, the distinct concepts of hazards versus risks need to be separated to determine how biodiversity and its drivers may act differently on each. This distinction is particularly important since it illustrates that disease emergence drivers in humans could be quite different to the general relationship between biodiversity and transmission of endemic pathogens. Second, the interactive relationship among biodiversity, anthropogenic change and zoonotic disease risk, including both direct and indirect effects, needs to be recognized and accounted for. By carefully disentangling these interactions between humans' activities and pathogen circulation in wildlife, we suggest that conservation efforts could mitigate disease risks and hazards in novel ways that complement more typical disease control efforts.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of pathogen ecology, including the impacts of environmental factors on pathogen and host dynamics, is essential for determining the risk that zoonotic pathogens pose to people. This review synthesizes the scientific literature on environmental factors that influence the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic microparasites (bacteria, viruses and protozoa) in globally invasive urban exploiter wildlife species (i.e., rock doves [Columba livia domestica], European starlings [Sturnus vulgaris], house sparrows [Passer domesticus], Norway rats [Rattus norvegicus], black rats [R. rattus] and house mice [Mus musculus]). Pathogen ecology, including prevalence and pathogen characteristics, is influenced by geographical location, habitat, season and weather. The prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in mice and rats varies markedly over short geographical distances, but tends to be highest in ports, disadvantaged (e.g., low income) and residential areas. Future research should use epidemiological approaches, including random sampling and robust statistical analyses, to evaluate a range of biotic and abiotic environmental factors at spatial scales suitable for host home range sizes. Moving beyond descriptive studies to uncover the causal factors contributing to uneven pathogen distribution among wildlife hosts in urban environments may lead to targeted surveillance and intervention strategies. Application of this knowledge to urban maintenance and planning may reduce the potential impacts of urban wildlife-associated zoonotic diseases on people.},

	abstract = {Increasing human population size and the concomitant expansion of urbanisation significantly impact natural ecosystems and native fauna globally. Successful conservation management relies on precise information on the factors associated with wildlife population decline, which are challenging to acquire from natural populations. Wildlife Rehabilitation Centres (WRC) provide a rich source of this information. However, few researchers have conducted large-scale longitudinal studies, with most focussing on narrow taxonomic ranges, suggesting that WRC-associated data remains an underutilised resource, and may provide a fuller understanding of the anthropogenic threats facing native fauna. We analysed admissions and outcomes data from a WRC in Queensland, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, to determine the major factors driving admissions and morbidity of native animals in a region experiencing rapid and prolonged urban expansion. We studied 31,626 admissions of 83 different species of native birds, reptiles, amphibians, marsupials and eutherian mammals from 2006 to 2017. While marsupial admissions were highest (41.3\%), admissions increased over time for all species and exhibited seasonal variation (highest in Spring to Summer), consistent with known breeding seasons. Causes for admission typically associated with human influenced activities were dominant and exhibited the highest mortality rates. Car strikes were the most common reason for admission (34.7\%), with dog attacks (9.2\%), entanglements (7.2\%), and cat attacks (5.3\%) also high. Admissions of orphaned young and overt signs of disease were significant at 24.6\% and 9.7\%, respectively. Mortality rates were highest following dog attacks (72.7\%) and car strikes (69.1\%) and lowest in orphaned animals (22.1\%). Our results show that WRC databases offer rich opportunities for wildlife monitoring and provide quantification of the negative impacts of human activities on ecosystem stability and wildlife health. The imminent need for urgent, proactive conservation management to ameliorate the negative impacts of human activities on wildlife is clearly evident from our results.},

Statistical analyses of metric characters revealed significant differences between the two species and among populations of I. holocyclus. However, no single metric character permitted unequivocal identification of all specimens. Discriminant function analyses were employed, resulting in the differentiation of all specimens of both males and females of the two species. In the larval stages, the numbers of marginal dorsal setae and supplementary setae, as well as the lengths of posterior marginal dorsal setae, allowed identification of the two species. The results highlight the advantages of utilising morphological methods in conjunction with genetic techniques to provide markers for accurate identification and characterisation in instances in which taxonomic confusion exists.},

Infections of laboratory-reared Culex quinquefasciatus feeding on infected snakes, as well as experimental infection of juvenile Python regius by ingestion of infected mosquitoes, were performed to complete the life cycle. Similarly, transmission to different snake species \{\vphantom{\}}Boa constrictor and Lamprophis fuliginosus) and lizards (Lepidodactylus lugubris) was performed to assess the host specificity. Isolates were compared with Hepatozoon species from sub-Saharan reptiles and described as a new species based on the morphology, phylogenetic analysis, and a complete life cycle.},

Our results highlight the value in repurposing metagenomic data generated for viral discovery to reveal insights into the biology of other parasites. Evaluating whether the presence of T. cruzi in the saliva of two hematophagous bat species represents an ecological route for zoonotic transmission of Chagas disease is an interesting avenue for future research.},

Wild populations of the endangered Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii, are experiencing devastating losses from a novel transmissible cancer, devil facial tumour disease (DFTD); however, despite the rapid decline of this species, there is currently no information on the presence of haemoprotozoan parasites. In the present study, 95 Tasmanian devil blood samples were collected from four populations in Tasmania, Australia, which underwent molecular screening to detect four major groups of haemoprotozoa: (i) trypanosomes, (ii) piroplasms, (iii) Hepatozoon, and (iv) haemosporidia. Sequence results revealed Trypanosoma infections in 32/95 individuals. Trypanosoma copemani was identified in 10 Tasmanian devils from three sites and a second Trypanosoma sp. was identified in 22 individuals that were grouped within the poorly described T. cyclops clade. A single blood sample was positive for Babesia sp., which most closely matched Babesia lohae. No other blood protozoan parasite DNA was detected. This study provides the first insight into haemoprotozoa from the Tasmanian devil and the first identification of Trypanosoma and Babesia in this carnivorous marsupial.},

Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling was used to analyse patterns of both flea and trypanosome occurrence. Overall, males of all sizes and ages were more likely to be infested with fleas than their female counterparts. Flea prevalence also showed direct density dependence during the winter, but patterns of density dependence varied amongst body mass (age) classes during the summer. Trypanosome prevalence did not vary between the sexes but was positively related to past flea prevalence with a lag of 3 months, with the highest levels occurring during the autumn season. A convex age-prevalence distribution was observed, suggesting that individuals develop a degree of immunity to trypanosome infection with age and exposure. An interaction between age and whether the individual was new or recaptured suggested that infected animals are less likely to become territory holders than their uninfected counterparts.},

The aim of this study was to generate information on circulating trypanosomes and their eminent threat/risk to public health and livestock production of a steadily growing human and livestock population surrounding the park. We detected various trypanosomes circulating in different mammalian wildlife species in KNP in Zambia by applying a high throughput ITS1-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/nanopore sequencing method in combination with serum resistant associated-PCR/Sanger sequencing method. The prevalence rates of trypanosomes in hartebeest, sable antelope, buffalo, warthog, impala and lechwe were 6.4\%, 37.2\%, 13.2\%, 11.8\%, 2.8\% and 11.1\%, respectively. A total of six trypanosomes species or subspecies were detected in the wildlife examined, including Trypanosoma brucei brucei, T. godfreyi, T. congolense, T. simiae and T. theileri. Importantly we detected human infective T. b. rhodesiense in buffalo and sable antelope with a prevalence of 9.4\% and 12.5\%, respectively. In addition, T. b. rhodesiense was found in the only vervet monkey analyzed. The study thus reaffirmed that the Kafue ecosystem is a genuine neglected and re-emerging foci for human African trypanosomiasis. This is the first assessment of the trypanosome diversity circulating in free-ranging wildlife of the KNP.},

	abstract = {The roles and epidemiological features of tick-borne protozoans are not well elicited in wildlife. Babesia spp. are documented in many domestic animals, including cattle, horses, pigs, dogs and cats. Three cases affecting eastern grey kangaroos are described. The kangaroos exhibited neurological signs, depression and marked anaemia, and microscopic examination of blood smears revealed intraerythrocytic piroplasms. One to seven intraerythrocytic spherical, oval, pyriform and irregularly-shaped parasites consistent with Babesia spp. were seen in the blood smears and the percentage of infected erythrocytes was estimated to be approximately 7\% in each case. Data suggest that the tick vector for this kangaroo Babesia sp. is a Haemaphysalis species. For Case 2, ultrastructural examination of the erythrocytes of the renal capillaries showed parasites resembling Babesia spp. and 18 of 33 erythrocytes were infected. DNA sequencing of the amplified 18S rDNA confirmed that the observed intraerythrocytic piroplasms belong to the genus Babesia. The phylogenetic position of this new kangaroo Babesia sp. (de novo Babesia macropus), as a sister species to the new Australian woylie Babesia sp., suggests a close affinity to the described Afro-Eurasian species Babesia orientalis and Babesia occultans suggesting perhaps a common ancestor for the Babesia in kangaroos.},

As a contribution to resolving this problem, we propose a simple resampling approach to estimate several key sampling sizes for a DNA barcoding project. We illustrate our approach using both structured populations simulated under coalescent and real species of skipper butterflies. We found that sample sizes widely used in DNA barcoding are insufficient to assess the genetic diversity of a species, population structure impacts the estimation of the sample sizes, and hence will bias the species identification potentially.},

	abstract = {Background: Piroplasms are vector-borne intracellular hemoprotozoan parasites that infect wildlife and livestock. Wildlife species are reservoir hosts to a diversity of piroplasms and play an important role in the circulation, maintenance and evolution of these parasites. The potential for likely spillover of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic piroplasm parasites from wildlife to livestock is underlined when a common ecological niche is shared in the presence of a competent vector. Method: To investigate piroplasm diversity in wildlife and the cattle population of the greater Kafue ecosystem, we utilized PCR to amplify the 18S rRNA V4 hyper-variable region and meta-barcoding strategy using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform and amplicon sequence variant (ASV)-based bioinformatics pipeline to generate high-resolution data that discriminate sequences down to a single nucleotide difference. Results: A parasite community of 45 ASVs corresponding to 23 species consisting of 4 genera of Babesia, Theileria, Hepatozoon and Colpodella, were identified in wildlife and the cattle population from the study area. Theileria species were detected in buffalo, impala, hartebeest, sable antelope, sitatunga, wild dog and cattle. In contrast, Babesia species were only observed in cattle and wild dog. Our results demonstrate possible spillover of these hemoprotozoan parasites from wildlife, especially buffalo, to the cattle population in the wildlife-livestock interface. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the deep amplicon sequencing of the 18S rRNA V4 hyper-variable region for wildlife was informative. Our results illustrated the diversity of piroplasma and the specificity of their hosts. They led us to speculate a possible ecological cycle including transmission from wildlife to domestic animals in the greater Kafue ecosystem. Thus, this approach may contribute to the establishment of appropriate disease control strategies in wildlife-livestock interface areas.},

	abstract = {The taxonomy of the order Piroplasmida, which includes a number of clinically and economically relevant organisms, is a hotly debated topic amongst parasitologists. Three genera (Babesia, Theileria, and Cytauxzoon) are recognized based on parasite life cycle characteristics, but molecular phylogenetic analyses of 18S sequences have suggested the presence of five or more distinct Piroplasmida lineages. Despite these important advancements, a few studies have been unable to define the taxonomic relationships of some organisms (e.g. C. felis and T. equi) with respect to other Piroplasmida. Additional evidence from mitochondrial genome sequences and synteny should aid in the inference of Piroplasmida phylogeny and resolution of taxonomic uncertainties. In this study, we have amplified, sequenced, and annotated seven previously uncharacterized mitochondrial genomes (Babesia canis, Babesia vogeli, Babesia rossi, Babesia sp. Coco, Babesia conradae, Babesia microti-like sp., and Cytauxzoon felis) and identified additional ribosomal fragments in ten previously characterized mitochondrial genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated mitochondrial and 18S sequences as well as cox1 amino acid sequence identified five distinct Piroplasmida groups, each of which possesses a unique mitochondrial genome structure. Specifically, our results confirm the existence of four previously identified clades (B. microti group, Babesia sensu stricto, Theileria equi, and a Babesia sensu latu group that includes B. conradae) while supporting the integration of Theileria and Cytauxzoon species into a single fifth taxon. Although known biological characteristics of Piroplasmida corroborate the proposed phylogeny, more investigation into parasite life cycles is warranted to further understand the evolution of the Piroplasmida. Our results provide an evolutionary framework for comparative biology of these important animal and human pathogens and help focus renewed efforts toward understanding the phylogenetic relationships within the group},

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of diversity profiles in disease investigations of monotremes. Using small subunit (18S) rDNA amplicon deep-sequencing we demonstrated the presence of apicomplexan parasites and confirmed by direct and cloned amplicon gene sequencing Theileria ornithorhynchi, Theileria tachyglossi, Eimeria echidnae and Cryptosporidium fayeri. Using a combination of samples from healthy and diseased animals, we show a close evolutionary relationship between species of coccidia (Eimeria) and piroplasms (Theileria) from the echidna and platypus. The presence of E. echidnae was demonstrated in faeces and tissues affected by disseminated coccidiosis. Moreover, the presence of E. echidnae DNA in the blood of echidnas was associated with atoxoplasma-like stages in white blood cells, suggesting Hepatozoon tachyglossi blood stages are disseminated E. echidnae stages. These next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are suited to material and organisms that have not been previously characterised and for which the material is scarce. The deep sequencing approach supports traditional diagnostic methods, including microscopy, clinical pathology and histopathology, to better define the status quo. This approach is particularly suitable for wildlife disease investigation.},

Although various molecular assessments of these parasites have been conducted in lizards from Africa and Europe, similar studies are needed for South American lizards. Through amplification and sequencing of fragments of the 18S rRNA gene, we assess the prevalence of Hepatozoon parasites in 230 geckos from South America, including the endemic species Hemidactylus agrius, Hemidactylus brasilianus, Lygodactylus klugei, Phyllopezus pollicaris, Phyllopezus periosus, and an exotic species, Hemidactylus mabouia. We found an overall low prevalence of Hepatozoon infection (7/230, 3\%) with only 3 of the 6 host species infected with Hepatozoon (Hemidactylus mabouia, P. pollicaris, and P. periosus). Within the 7 infected host samples, 5 genetically distinct lineages of Hepatozoon parasites were identified, only 1 of which was similar to previously published haplotypes. Thus, although prevalence is low, genetically based diversity of Hepatozoon in geckos from South America is very high. Three of these lineages appear basal to 1 of the major clades of Hepatozoon, suggesting that this clade might have originated in South America, and thereby indicating a potential phylogeographic pattern that had not been previously identified. Future studies should assess the distribution and competence of invertebrate hosts in the regions analyzed, and Hepatozoon diversity in other less well-known regions of the world.},

	abstract = {High-throughput DNA metabarcoding of amplicon sizes below 500 bp has revolutionized the analysis of environmental microbial diversity. However, these short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. This lesser phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons may be overcome by new long-read sequencing technologies. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain an {\textasciitilde}4500-bp region spanning most of the eukaryotic small subunit (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal DNA genes. We first treated the CCS reads with a novel curation workflow, generating 650 high-quality operational taxonomic units (OTUs) containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions. To assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based methods. The taxonomically annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing us to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1,019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58\%) corresponded to the new long environmental OTUs. The long reads also allowed us to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny. Together, our results show that long amplicons can be treated in a full phylogenetic framework to provide greater taxonomic resolution and a robust evolutionary perspective to environmental DNA.},

Therefore, a reclassification of this unusual intraerythrocytic apicomplexan will require additional life cycle, microscopic, and molecular analyses.},

The parasitaemia persisted for 3 months or more but was observed to clear within 3 years in captivity. The parasite appears not to significantly debilitate its infected host. Traditionally, using morphological identification, the intraerythrocytic parasite would have been classified within the Hepatozoon species typically found in red blood cells. However, molecular diagnostic techniques targeting the parasite's SSU rDNA and LSU rDNA demonstrated the unusual identity of this blood parasite and disputed its identity as a haemogregarine parasite of the genus Hepatozoon. The sequence was compared with available sequences from diverse mammalian and non-mammalian blood parasites (malaria, piroplasms, hemosporidia and sarcosporidia). The intraerythrocytic blood parasite was found to be most closely related to the cyst-forming coccidia including Besnoitia spp., Cystoisospora spp., Hammondia spp., Hyaloklossia lieberkuehni, Neospora caninum, Sarcocystis spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. The life cycle of this intraerythrocytic parasite remains unknown. The presented DNA identification demonstrates its suitability for an improved identification of blood parasites.},

Nowhere are the effects of such parasites more pronounced than in developing countries in the tropics where the abundance and diversity of ectoparasites that transmit these pathogens reaches its zenith. Here we describe the use of a novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) metabarcoding based approach to screen for a range of blood-borne apicomplexan and kinetoplastid parasites from populations of temple dogs in Bangkok, Thailand. Our methodology elucidated high rates of Hepatozoon canis and Babesia vogeli infection, whilst also being able to characterise co-infections. In addition, our approach was confirmed to be more sensitive than conventional endpoint PCR diagnostic methods. Two kinetoplastid infections were also detected, including one by Trypanosoma evansi, a pathogen that is rarely screened for in dogs and another by Parabodo caudatus, a poorly documented organism that has been previously reported inhabiting the urinary tract of a dog with haematuria. Such results demonstrate the power of NGS methodologies to unearth rare and unusual pathogens, especially in regions of the world where limited information on canine vector-borne haemoparasites exist.},

	abstract = {Rodents are reservoirs of numerous zoonotic diseases caused by bacteria, protozoans, or viruses. In Gabon, the circulation and maintenance of rodent-borne zoonotic infectious agents are poorly studied and are often limited to one type of pathogen. Among the three existing studies on this topic, two are focused on a zoonotic virus, and the third is focused on rodent Plasmodium . In this study, we searched for a wide range of bacteria, protozoa and viruses in different organs of rodents from the town of Franceville in Gabon. Samples from one hundred and ninety-eight (198) small mammals captured, including two invasive rodent species, five native rodent species and 19 shrews belonging to the Soricidae family, were screened. The investigated pathogens were bacteria from the Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae families, Mycoplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., Orientia spp., Occidentia spp., Leptospira spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis , Coxiella burnetii , and Yersinia pestis; parasites from class Kinetoplastida spp. ( Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma spp.), Piroplasmidae spp., and Toxoplasma gondii ; and viruses from Paramyxoviridae , Hantaviridae , Flaviviridae and Mammarenavirus spp. We identified the following pathogenic bacteria: Anaplasma spp. (8.1\%; 16/198), Bartonella spp. (6.6\%; 13/198), Coxiella spp. (5.1\%; 10/198) and Leptospira spp. (3.5\%; 7/198); and protozoans: Piroplasma sp. (1\%; 2/198), Toxoplasma gondii (0.5\%; 1/198), and Trypanosoma sp. (7\%; 14/198). None of the targeted viral genes were detected. These pathogens were found in Gabonese rodents, mainly Lophuromys sp., Lemniscomys striatus and Praomys sp. We also identified new genotypes: Candidatus Bartonella gabonensis and Uncultured Anaplasma spp. This study shows that rodents in Gabon harbor some human pathogenic bacteria and protozoans. It is necessary to determine whether the identified microorganisms are capable of undergoing zoonotic transmission from rodents to humans and if they may be responsible for human cases of febrile disease of unknown etiology in Gabon.},

Herein, we conducted an epidemiological study on their bacterial communities. One hundred and seventy-one (171) invasive and native rodents were captured, 50 from outdoor trapping sites and 121 rodents from indoor habitats, consisting of five species. The DNA of thirteen pathogens was successfully screened on the rodents' spleens. We found: 2.3\% of spleens positive to Piroplasmida and amplified one which gave a potentially new species Candidatus "Theileria senegalensis"; 9.35\% of Bartonella spp. and amplified 10, giving three genotypes; 3.5\% of filariasis species; 18.12\% of Anaplasmataceae species and amplified only 5, giving a new potential species Candidatus "Ehrlichia senegalensis"; 2.33\% of Hepatozoon spp.; 3.5\% of Kinetoplastidae spp.; and 15.2\% of Borrelia spp. and amplified 8 belonging all to Borrelia crocidurae. Some of the species of pathogens carried by the rodents of our studied area may be unknown because most of those we have identified are new species. In one bacterial taxon, Anaplasma, a positive correlation between host body mass and infection was found.

However, most studies assessed tick microbiomes without prior decontamination of the tick surface, which may alter the results and mislead conclusions regarding the composition of the tick-borne microbiome. The aim of this study was to test four different decontamination methods, namely (i.) 70\% ethanol, (ii.) DNA Away, (iii.) 5\% sodium hypochlorite and (iv.) Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL), which have been previously reported for tick surface and animal or human skin decontamination. To test the efficiency of decontamination, we contaminated each tick with a defined mixture of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, dog saliva and human sweat. No contamination was used as a negative control, and for a positive control, a no decontamination strategy was carried out. After nucleic acid extraction, the recovery rate of contaminants was determined for RNA and DNA samples by qPCR and tick-borne microbiome analyses by bacterial 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Ticks treated with 5\% sodium hypochlorite revealed the lowest number of contaminants followed by DNA Away, RSDL and 70\% ethanol. Moreover, tick microbiomes after 5\% sodium hypochlorite decontamination clustered with negative controls. Therefore, the efficiency of decontamination was optimal with 5\% sodium hypochlorite and is recommended for upcoming studies to address the unbiased detection of tick-borne pathogens.},

Five of the seven suspected cases were positive by the PCR assay using DNA extracted from whole blood as the template, compared with a serologic assay that identified only one positive sample. The PCR assay using DNA extracted from the corresponding serum samples as the template identified three positive samples. The sensitivity of the assay on human samples was examined, and the limit of detection was shown to be fewer than 2 copies of the 16S rRNA gene. The application of the assay to nonhuman samples demonstrated products amplified from template DNA extracted from Ixodes scapularis ticks collected in Rhode Island and from EDTA-blood specimens obtained from white-tailed deer in Maryland.

	abstract = {Background: Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) has enabled characterization of diverse bacterial communities, yet the application of TADS to communities of parasites has been relatively slow to advance. The greatest obstacle to this has been the genetic diversity of parasitic agents, which include helminths, protozoa, arthropods, and some acanthocephalans. Meanwhile, universal amplification of conserved loci from all parasites without amplifying host DNA has proven challenging. Pan-eukaryotic PCRs preferentially amplify the more abundant host DNA, obscuring parasite-derived reads following TADS. Flaherty et al. (2018) described a panparasitic TADS method involving amplification of eukaryotic 18S rDNA regions possessing restriction sites only in vertebrates. Using this method, host DNA in total DNA extracts could be selectively digested prior to PCR using restriction enzymes, thereby increasing the number of parasite-derived reads obtained following NGS. This approach showed promise though was only as sensitive as conventional PCR. Results: Here, we expand on this work by designing a second set of pan-eukaryotic primers flanking the priming sites already described, enabling nested PCR amplification of the established 18S rDNA target. This nested approach facilitated introduction of a second restriction digestion between the first and second PCR, reducing the proportional mass of amplifiable host-derived DNA while increasing the number of PCR amplification cycles. We applied this method to blood specimens containing Babesia, Plasmodium, various kinetoplastids, and filarial nematodes and confirmed its limit of detection (LOD) to be approximately 10-fold lower than previously described, falling within the range of most qPCR methods. Conclusions: The assay detects and differentiates the major malaria parasites of humans, along with several other clinically important blood parasites. This represents an important step towards a TADS-based universal parasite diagnostic (UPDx) test with a sufficient LOD for routine applications.},

	abstract = {Exotic species have had devastating impacts worldwide and are a major threat to native wildlife. Human commensal species (hereafter commensals) are a special class of exotic species that live largely off the resources associated with human activity. The encroachment of commensals from an urban area into surrounding bushland has been frequently overlooked as an important component of urban impacts, even though human-commensals are common to many urban regions globally. In this review, we present theoretical and empirical evidence for the processes and outcomes occurring when exotic commensal species encroach into native bushland. Specifically we ask when, how and why exotic commensal species encroach into bushland, what determines whether they establish, and what are the ecological consequences. We focus on the black rat, Rattus rattus, arguably the archetypal commensal species with a cosmopolitan distribution and the greatest potential for ecological damage of all the commensal rodents. We expect that the processes that we outline apply to other commensal species more broadly. We argue that commensals are in fact natives of the urban milieu and only become alien when they encroach into peri-urban bushland. We propose that the mechanisms of this encroachment will be different from those of other, non-commensal exotic species because urban areas act as dispersal hubs to overcome many of the barriers of invasion that other exotic species face. We suggest that resource supplementation by urban areas creates a great potential for promoting encroachment, invasion as well as impact. However, biotic and abiotic barriers to invasion are still relevant for commensals, highlighting the need to maintain the integrity of ecosystems and wildlife populations in urban edges so as to prevent commensal incursion. We examine how commensal black rats affect wildlife via three fundamental mechanisms, namely, predation, disease transfer and competition for resources, and also consider their possible positive impacts acting as functional replacements for lost natives. We conclude the review with an outline of research priorities and future directions that are essential for progressing our understanding of the ecology of commensal species.},

	abstract = {The ecology of infectious disease in wildlife has become a pivotal theme in animal and public health. Studies of infectious disease ecology rely on robust surveillance of pathogens in reservoir hosts, often based on serology, which is the detection of specific antibodies in the blood and is used to infer infection history. However, serological data can be inaccurate for inference to infection history for a variety of reasons. Two major aspects in any serological test can substantially impact results and interpretation of antibody prevalence data: cross-reactivity and cut-off thresholds used to discriminate positive and negative reactions. Given the ubiquitous use of serology as a tool for surveillance and epidemiological modeling of wildlife diseases, it is imperative to consider the strengths and limitations of serological test methodologies and interpretation of results, particularly when using data that may affect management and policy for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in wildlife. Greater consideration of population age structure and cohort representation, serological test suitability and standardized sample collection protocols can ensure that reliable data are obtained for downstream modeling applications to characterize, and evaluate interventions for, wildlife disease systems.},

In this review, we synthesize the current state of mosquito-borne viruses impacting non-human vertebrates in Australia, including diseases that could be introduced due to local mosquito distribution. Given the unique island biogeography of Australia and the endemism of vertebrate species (including macropods and monotremes), Australia is highly susceptible to foreign mosquito species becoming established, and mosquito-borne viruses becoming endemic alongside novel reservoirs. For each virus, we summarize the known geographic distribution, mosquito vectors, vertebrate hosts, clinical signs and treatments, and highlight the importance of including non-human vertebrates in the assessment of future disease outbreaks. The mosquito-borne viruses discussed can impact wildlife, livestock, and companion animals, causing significant changes to Australian ecology and economy. The complex nature of mosquito-borne disease, and challenges in assessing the impacts to non-human vertebrate species, makes this an important topic to periodically review.},

	abstract = {Abstract Spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selection is predicted to influence the evolutionary trajectory of host populations and lead to spatial variation in their immunogenetic composition. However, to date few studies have been able to directly link small-scale spatial variation in infection risk to host immune gene evolution in natural, nonhuman populations. Here, we use a natural rodent?Borrelia system to test for associations between landscape-level spatial variation in Borrelia infection risk along replicated elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) evolution, a candidate gene for Borrelia resistance, across bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations. We found that Borrelia infection risk (i.e., the product of Borrelia prevalence in questing ticks and the average tick load of voles at a sampling site) was spatially variable and significantly negatively associated with elevation. Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and their Borrelia infection status. The TLR2 variant associated with a reduced likelihood of Borrelia infection was most common in rodent populations at lower elevations that face a high Borrelia infection risk, and its frequency changed in accordance with the change in Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. These results suggest that small-scale spatial variation in parasite-mediated selection affects the immunogenetic composition of natural host populations, providing a striking example that the microbial environment shapes the evolution of the host's immune system in the wild.},

	abstract = {Migrations, i.e. the recurring, roundtrip movement of animals between distant and distinct habitats, occur among diverse metazoan taxa. Although traditionally linked to avoidance of food shortages, predators or harsh abiotic conditions, there is increasing evidence that parasites may have played a role in the evolution of migration. On the one hand, selective pressures from parasites can favour migratory strategies that allow either avoidance of infections or recovery from them. On the other hand, infected animals incur physiological costs that may limit their migratory abilities, affecting their speed, the timing of their departure or arrival, and/or their condition upon reaching their destination. During migration, reduced immunocompetence as well as exposure to different external conditions and parasite infective stages can influence infection dynamics. Here, we first explore whether parasites represent extra costs for their hosts during migration. We then review how infection dynamics and infection risk are affected by host migration, thereby considering parasites as both causes and consequences of migration. We also evaluate the comparative evidence testing the hypothesis that migratory species harbour a richer parasite fauna than their closest free-living relatives, finding general support for the hypothesis. Then we consider the implications of host migratory behaviour for parasite ecology and evolution, which have received much less attention. Parasites of migratory hosts may achieve much greater spatial dispersal than those of non-migratory hosts, expanding their geographical range, and providing more opportunities for host-switching. Exploiting migratory hosts also exerts pressures on the parasite to adapt its phenology and life-cycle duration, including the timing of major developmental, reproduction and transmission events. Natural selection may even favour parasites that manipulate their host's migratory strategy in ways that can enhance parasite transmission. Finally, we propose a simple integrated framework based on eco-evolutionary feedbacks to consider the reciprocal selection pressures acting on migratory hosts and their parasites. Host migratory strategies and parasite traits evolve in tandem, each acting on the other along two-way causal paths and feedback loops. Their likely adjustments to predicted climate change will be understood best from this coevolutionary perspective.},

Molecular and morphological analysis was performed on 86 blood samples collected from seven different species of microbats in Western Australia. Phylogenetic analysis on 18S rDNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) sequences identified Trypanosoma dionisii in five different Australian native species of microbats; Chalinolobus gouldii, Chalinolobus morio, Nyctophilus geoffroyi, Nyctophilus major and Scotorepens balstoni. In addition, two novel, genetically distinct T. dionisii genotypes were detected and named T. dionisii genotype Aus 1 and T. dionisii genotype Aus 2. Genotype Aus 2 was the most prevalent and infected 20.9\% (18/86) of bats in the present study, while genotype Aus 1 was less prevalent and was identified in 5.8\% (5/86) of Australian bats. Morphological analysis was conducted on trypomastigotes identified in blood films, with morphological parameters consistent with trypanosome species in the subgenus Schizotrypanum. This is the first report of T. dionisii in Australia and in Australian native bats, which further contributes to the global distribution of this cosmopolitan bat trypanosome.},

In addition, the organisms studied are highly dissimilar, ranging from platyhelminths, nematodes and acanthocephalans to insects, arachnids, crustaceans and protists. This review of the parasites of wildlife in Australia highlights the advances made to date, focussing on the work, interests and major findings of researchers over the years and identifies current significant gaps that exist in our understanding. The review is divided into three sections covering protist, helminth and arthropod parasites. The challenge to document the diversity of parasites in Australia continues at a traditional level but the advent of molecular methods has heightened the significance of this issue. Modern methods are providing an avenue for major advances in documenting and restructuring the phylogeny of protistan parasites in particular, while facilitating the recognition of species complexes in helminth taxa previously defined by traditional morphological methods. The life cycles, ecology and general biology of most parasites of wildlife in Australia are extremely poorly understood. While the phylogenetic origins of the Australian vertebrate fauna are complex, so too are the likely origins of their parasites, which do not necessarily mirror those of their hosts. This aspect of parasite evolution is a continuing area for research in the case of helminths, but remains to be addressed for many other parasitic groups.},

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicons has opened up the door to large-scale comparative studies of microbial community structures. The short reads currently produced by massively parallel sequencing technologies make the choice of sequencing region crucial for accurate phylogenetic assignments. While for 16S rDNA, relevant regions have been well described, no truly systematic design of 18S rDNA primers aimed at resolving eukaryotic diversity has yet been reported. Here we used 31,862 18S rDNA sequences to design a set of broad-taxonomic range degenerate PCR primers. We simulated the phylogenetic information that each candidate primer pair would retrieve using paired- or single-end reads of various lengths, representing different sequencing technologies. Primer pairs targeting the V4 region performed best, allowing discrimination with paired-end reads as short as 150 bp (with 75\% accuracy at genus level). The conditions for PCR amplification were optimised for one of these primer pairs and this was used to amplify 18S rDNA sequences from isolates as well as from a range of environmental samples which were then Illumina sequenced and analysed, revealing good concordance between expected and observed results. In summary, the reported primer sets will allow minimally biased assessment of eukaryotic diversity in different microbial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The use of high-throughput sequencing technologies with the 16S rRNA gene for characterization of bacterial and archaeal communities has become routine. However, the adoption of sequencing methods for eukaryotes has been slow, despite their significance to natural and engineered systems. There are large variations among the target genes used for amplicon sequencing, and for the 18S rRNA gene, there is no consensus on which hypervariable region provides the most suitable representation of diversity. Additionally, it is unclear how much PCR/sequencing bias affects the depiction of community structure using current primers. The present study amplified the V4 and V8-V9 regions from seven microalgal mock communities as well as eukaryotic communities from freshwater, coastal, and wastewater samples to examine the effect of PCR/sequencing bias on community structure and membership. We found that degeneracies on the 3= end of the current V4-specific primers impact read length and mean relative abundance. Furthermore, the PCR/sequencing error is markedly higher for GC-rich members than for communities with balanced GC content. Importantly, the V4 region failed to reliably capture 2 of the 12 mock community members, and the V8-V9 hypervariable region more accurately represents mean relative abundance and alpha and beta diversity. Overall, the V4 and V8-V9 regions show similar community representations over freshwater, coastal, and wastewater environments, but specific samples show markedly different communities. These results indicate that multiple primer sets may be advantageous for gaining a more complete understanding of community structure and highlight the importance of including mock communities composed of species of interest.},

	abstract = {Background: Several of the most devastating human diseases are caused by eukaryotic parasites transmitted by arthropod vectors or through food and water contamination. These pathogens only represent a fraction of all unicellular eukaryotes and helminths that are present in the environment and many uncharacterized organisms might have subtle but pervasive effects on health, including by modifying the microbiome where they reside. Unfortunately, while we have modern molecular tools to characterize bacterial and, to a lesser extent, fungal communities, we lack suitable methods to comprehensively investigate and characterize most unicellular eukaryotes and helminths: the detection of these organisms often relies on microscopy that cannot differentiate related organisms, while molecular assays can only detect the pathogens specifically tested. Results: Here, we describe a novel sequencing-based assay, akin to bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing, that enables high-throughput detection and characterization of a wide range of unicellular eukaryotes and helminths, including those from taxonomical groups containing all common human parasites. We designed and evaluated taxon-specific PCR primer pairs that selectively amplify all species from eight taxonomical groups (Apicomplexa, Amoeba, Diplomonadida, Kinetoplastida, Parabasalia, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes, and Microsporidia). We then used these primers to screen DNA extracted from clinical, biological, and environmental samples, and after next-generation sequencing, identified both known and previously undescribed organisms from most taxa targeted. Conclusions: This novel high-throughput assay enables comprehensive detection and identification of eukaryotic parasites and related organisms, from a wide range of complex biological and environmental samples. This approach can be easily deployed to many settings and will efficiently complement existing methods and provide a holistic perspective on the microbiome.},

We collected individual blood samples from cattle (n = 212) and water buffalo (n = 154), extracted genomic DNAs, PCR-amplified the V4 hypervariable region of 18S small subunit rRNA gene from piroplasms, sequenced amplicons using Illumina technology, and then analysed data using bioinformatic platforms. The results revealed piroplasms in 68.9\% (252/366) samples, with overall occurrence being markedly higher in cattle (85.8\%) than in water buffaloes (45.5\%). Babesia (B.) occultans and Theileria (T.) lestoquardi-like species were recorded for the first time in Pakistan, and, overall, T. annulata was most commonly detected (65.8\%) followed by B. bovis (7.1\%), B. bigemina (4.4\%), and T. orientalis (0.5\%), with the genetic variability within B. bovis being pronounced. The occurrence and composition of piroplasm species varied markedly across different agro-ecological zones. The high detection of T. annulata in asymptomatic animals suggested a relatively high level of endemic stability of tropical theileriosis in the bovine population.},

Results: In this study we demonstrate that contaminating DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction kits and other laboratory reagents, varies greatly in composition between different kits and kit batches, and that this contamination critically impacts results obtained from samples containing a low microbial biomass. Contamination impacts both PCR-based 16S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics. We provide an extensive list of potential contaminating genera, and guidelines on how to mitigate the effects of contamination. Conclusions: These results suggest that caution should be advised when applying sequence-based techniques to the study of microbiota present in low biomass environments. Concurrent sequencing of negative control samples is strongly advised.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40168-018-0540-2},
	abstract = {Background Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) of the 16S rRNA gene is commonly used to explore and characterize bacterial microbiomes. Meanwhile, attempts to apply TADS to the detection and characterization of entire parasitic communities have been hampered since conserved regions of many conserved parasite genes, such as the 18S rRNA gene, are also conserved in their eukaryotic hosts. As a result, targeted amplification of 18S rRNA from clinical samples using universal primers frequently results in competitive priming and preferential amplification of host DNA. Here, we describe a novel method that employs a single pair of universal primers to capture all blood-borne parasites while reducing host 18S rRNA template and enhancing the amplification of parasite 18S rRNA for TADS. This was achieved using restriction enzymes to digest the 18S rRNA gene at cut sites present only in the host sequence prior to PCR amplification. Results This method was validated against 16 species of blood-borne helminths and protozoa. Enzyme digestion prior to PCR enrichment and Illumina amplicon deep sequencing led to a substantial reduction in human reads and a corresponding 5- to 10-fold increase in parasite reads relative to undigested samples. This method allowed for discrimination of all common parasitic agents found in human blood, even in cases of multi-parasite infection, and markedly reduced the limit of detection in digested versus undigested samples. Conclusions The results herein provide a novel methodology for the reduction of host DNA prior to TADS and establish the validity of a next-generation sequencing-based platform for universal parasite detection.},

Infection with B. macropus is recorded for the first time in agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) from far north Queensland. Animals in which B. macropus infection was considered to be the primary cause of morbidity had marked anaemia, lethargy and neurological signs, and often died. In these cases, parasitised erythrocytes were few or undetectable in peripheral blood samples but were sequestered in large numbers within small vessels of visceral organs, particularly in the kidney and brain, associated with distinctive clusters of extraerythrocytic organisms. Initial identification of this piroplasm in peripheral blood smears and in tissue impression smears and histological sections was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy and molecular analysis. Samples of kidney, brain or blood were tested using PCR and DNA sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA and heat shock protein 70 gene using primers specific for piroplasms. The piroplasm detected in these samples had 100\% sequence identity in the 18S rRNA region with the recently described Babesia macropus in two eastern grey kangaroos from New South Wales and Queensland, and a high degree of similarity to an unnamed Babesia sp. recently detected in three woylies (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) in Western Australia.},

	abstract = {The Australian mammalian fauna is marked by high endemism and evolutionary distinctiveness and comprises monotreme, marsupial, and eutherian (`placental') native species. It has suffered the highest extinction rate of any mammalian fauna in any global region; surviving species are threatened by competition and predation from a range of introduced mammal species, and receive low levels of conservation-oriented funding compared with species in many other countries. We investigated research foci on this unique fauna by using species h-indices (SHI), and identified both taxonomic bias and subject bias in research effort and research impact for 331 Australian terrestrial mammal species. Species broadly fell into categories we labelled as the `good', the `bad', and the `ugly'. The majority of studies on monotremes and marsupials (the `good') are directed towards their physiology and anatomy, with a smaller ecological focus. By contrast, introduced eutherians (the `bad') have attracted greater attention in terms of ecological research, with greater emphasis on methods and technique studies for population control. Despite making up 45\% of the 331 species studied, native rodents and bats (the `ugly') have attracted disproportionately little study. While research on invasive species is directed towards problem solving, many Australian native species of conservation significance have attracted little research effort, little recognition, and little funding. Current global and national conservation funding largely overlooks non-charismatic species, and yet these species may arguably be most in need of scientific and management research effort.},

	abstract = {Introduced wildlife may be important alternative hosts for generalist ticks that cause health issues for humans and companion animals in urban areas, but to date are rarely considered as part of the tick-host community compared to native wildlife. In Australia, European rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, are a widespread and abundant invasive species common to a range of human-modified ecosystems. To understand the potential role of rabbits in the life cycle of Australian ticks, we investigated the seasonal abundance of all tick life stages (larva, nymph, and adult) on rabbits collected from pest control programs in two urban forest remnants in Sydney, Australia. We also recorded whether larvae, nymphs, and adults were attached to the head, body, or limbs of rabbits to reveal patterns of tick attachment. Of the 2426 Ixodes ticks collected from 42 rabbits, larvae were by far the most abundant life stage (2360), peaking in abundance in autumn, while small numbers of nymphs (62) and adults (4) were present in winter and summer respectively. Larvae were found all over the body, whereas adults and nymphs were predominantly attached to the head, suggesting that the mature life stages use the host landscape differently, or that adults or nymphs may be groomed off the body. The most abundant tick species, as determined by morphology and DNA sequencing, was Ixodes holocyclus, a generalist tick responsible for significant human and companion animal health concerns in Australia. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of introduced wildlife in tick dynamics particularly in novel ecosystems where non-native hosts may be more abundant than native hosts.},

	abstract = {Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick-vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick-host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US.},

	abstract = {Background: The density of questing ticks infected with tick-borne pathogens is an important parameter that determines tick-borne disease risk. An important factor determining this density is the availability of different wildlife species as hosts for ticks and their pathogens. Here, we investigated how wildlife communities contribute to tickborne disease risk. The density of Ixodes ricinus nymphs infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum among 19 forest sites were correlated to the encounter probability of different vertebrate hosts, determined by encounter rates as measured by (camera) trapping and mathematical modeling. Result: We found that the density of any tick life stage was proportional to the encounter probability of ungulates. Moreover, the density of nymphs decreased with the encounter probability of hare, rabbit and red fox. The density of nymphs infected with the transovarially-transmitted B. miyamotoi increased with the density of questing nymphs and the encounter probability of bank vole. The density of nymphs infected with all other pathogens increased with the encounter probability of competent hosts: bank vole for Borrelia afzelii and N. mikurensis, ungulates for A. phagocytophilum and blackbird for Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana. The negative relationship we found was a decrease in the density of nymphs infected with B. garinii and B. valaisiana with the encounter probability of wood mouse. Conclusions: Only a few animal species drive the densities of infected nymphs in forested areas. There, foxes and leporids have negative effects on tick abundance, and consequently on the density of infected nymphs. The abundance of competent hosts generally drives the abundances of their tick-borne pathogen. A dilution effect was only observed for bird-associated Lyme spirochetes.},

	abstract = {Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 yr of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of cli- mate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator commu- nity structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Ana- plasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer 2 yr prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abun- dance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or win- ter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1 km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web per- spective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health.},

Surveillance of these pathogens at the wildlife interface is critical to informing public health strategies to limit their impact. In Australia, reptile-associated ticks such as Bothriocroton hydrosauri are the reservoirs for Rickettsia honei, the causative agent of Flinders Island spotted fever. In an effort to gain further insight into the potential for reptile-associated ticks to act as reservoirs for rickettsial infection, Rickettsia-specific PCR screening was performed on 64 Ambylomma albolimbatum ticks taken from shingleback skinks (Tiliqua rugosa) located in southern Western Australia. PCR screening revealed 92\% positivity for rickettsial DNA. PCR amplification and sequencing of phylogenetically informative rickettsial genes (ompA, ompB, gltA, sca4, and 17kda) suggested that the single rickettsial genotype detected represented a novel rickettsial species, genetically distinct from but closely related to Rickettsia gravesii and within the rickettsia spotted fever group (SFG). On the basis of this study and previous investigations, it would appear that Rickettsia spp. are endemic to reptile-associated tick species in Australia, with geographically distinct populations of the same tick species harboring genetically distinct SFG Rickettsia species. Further molecular epidemiology studies are required to understand the relationship between these diverse Rickettsiae and their tick hosts and the risk that they may pose to human and animal health.},

We review 46 previously published cases of QTT along with 16 cases discovered by active surveillance. QTT is usually a mild disease. Patients often have regional lymphadenopathy and eschars. Some have vesicular rashes. Because clinical fea- tures overlap, serologic tests are necessary to distinguish QTT from other endemic Australian rickettsial diseases (scrub and murine typhus). Only two tick vectors of R. australis have been identified: Ixodes holocyclus and Ixodes tasmani. Until rickettsiae are isolated from patients in Victoria and Tasmania, it remains unproven that spotted fever group infections in these locations are due to R. australis. However, available serologic, epidemiologic, and clinical data suggest that QTT is not confined to the area in which R. australis was first isolated (Queensland); rather, it occurs along a 3,200-km span of eastern coastal Australia, from tropical to temperate climates.},

	abstract = {Ticks are vectors of pathogens affecting human and animal health worldwide. Nevertheless, the ecological and evolutionary interactions between ticks, hosts, and pathogens are largely unknown. Here, we integrated a framework to evaluate the associations of the tick Ixodes ricinus with its hosts and environmental niches that impact pathogen circulation. The analysis of tick-hosts association suggested that mammals and lizards were the ancestral hosts of this tick species, and that a leap to Aves occurred around 120 M years ago. The signature of the environmental variables over the host's phylogeny revealed the existence of two clades of vertebrates diverging along a temperature and vegetation split. This is a robust proof that the tick probably experienced a colonization of new niches by adapting to a large set of new hosts, Aves. Interestingly, the colonization of Aves as hosts did not increase significantly the ecological niche of I. ricinus, but remarkably Aves are super-spreaders of pathogens. The disparate contribution of Aves to the tick-host-pathogen networks revealed that I. ricinus evolved to maximize habitat overlap with some hosts that are super-spreaders of pathogens. These results supported the hypothesis that large host networks are not a requirement of tick survival but pathogen circulation. The biological cost of tick adaptation to non-optimal environmental conditions might be balanced by molecular mechanisms triggered by the pathogens that we have only begun to understand.},

Vector competence is a component of vectorial capacity and depends on genetic determinants affecting the ability of a vector to transmit a pathogen. These determinants affect traits such as tick-host-pathogen and susceptibility to pathogen infection. Therefore, the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in tick-pathogen interactions that affect vector competence is essential for the identification of molecular drivers for tick-borne diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of tick-pathogen molecular interactions for bacteria, viruses, and protozoa affecting human and animal health. Additionally, the impact of tick microbiome on these interactions was considered. Results show that different pathogens evolved similar strategies such as manipulation of the immune response to infect vectors and facilitate multiplication and transmission. Furthermore, some of these strategies may be used by pathogens to infect both tick and mammalian hosts. Identification of interactions that promote tick survival, spread, and pathogen transmission provides the opportunity to disrupt these interactions and lead to a reduction in tick burden and the prevalence of tick-borne diseases. Targeting some of the similar mechanisms used by the pathogens for infection and transmission by ticks may assist in development of preventative strategies against multiple tick-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health1,2,3. Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID `events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8\%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease `hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.},

Despite strong advocacy for One Health, challenges for practical implementation remain. Here we discuss the value of the One Health approach for addressing global health challenges. We also share strategies applied to achieve successful outcomes through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program PREDICT project, which serve as useful case studies for implementing One Health approaches.

Specifically, for zoonotic diseases, knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of animal host distribution can be used to raise awareness of human risk and enhance early prediction accuracy of human incidence. Methods: To this end, we develop a spatiotemporal joint modeling framework to integrate human case data and animal host data to offer a modeling alternative for combining multiple surveillance data streams in a novel way. A case study is provided of spatiotemporal modeling of human tularemia incidence and rodent population data from Finnish health care districts during years 1995-2012. Results: Spatial and temporal information of rodent abundance was shown to be useful in predicting human cases and in improving tularemia risk estimates in 40 and 75\% of health care districts, respectively. The human relative risk estimates' standard deviation with rodent's information incorporated are smaller than those from the model that has only human incidence. Conclusions: These results support the integration of rodent population variables to reduce the uncertainty of tularemia risk estimates. However, more information on several covariates such as environmental, behavioral, and socio-economic factors can be investigated further to deeper understand the zoonotic relationship.},

We discuss these drivers in the context of evolutionary ecology and wildlife-human interactions. Ultimately, differentiating these mechanisms will require linking interspecific variation in life history with immunity, pathogen diversity, transmissibility, and zoonotic risk, and critical data gaps currently limit our ability to do so.

In this forum article, we highlight roles that wildlife hosts play in the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic, companion animal, livestock, and wildlife tick-borne pathogens. We begin by illustrating how wildlife contribute directly and indirectly to the increase and geographic expansion of ticks and their associated pathogens. Wildlife provide blood meals for tick growth and reproduction; serve as pathogen reservoirs; and can disperse ticks and pathogens-either through natural movement (e.g., avian migration) or through human-facilitated movement (e.g., wildlife translocations and trade). We then discuss opportunities to manage tick-borne disease through actions directed at wildlife hosts. To conclude, we highlight key gaps in our understanding of the ecology of tick-host interactions, emphasizing that wildlife host communities are themselves a very dynamic component of tick-pathogen-host systems and therefore complicate management of tick-borne diseases, and should be taken into account when considering host-targeted approaches. Effective management of wildlife to reduce tick-borne disease risk further requires consideration of the `human dimensions' of wildlife management.This includes understanding the public's diverse views and values about wildlife and wildlife impacts-including the perceived role of wildlife in fostering tick-borne diseases. Public health agencies should capitalize on the expertise of wildlife agencies when developing strategies to reduce tick-borne disease risks.},

Less understood is the impact of environmental change on the parasites harbored by endangered, extinct, and introduced species.

We screened 348 individual small mammals, representing 26 species, from both forested and non-forested habitats in rural Uganda. Using microscopy and PCR, we identified 18\% of individuals (order Rodentia) as positive for trypanosomes. Further phylogenetic analyses revealed two trypanosomes circulating-T. lewisi and T. varani. T. lewisi was found in seven species both native and invasive, while T. varani was identified in only three native forest species. The lack of T. varani in non-forested habitats suggests that it is a natural parasite of forest-dwelling rodents. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic disturbance may lead to spillover of an invasive parasite (T. lewisi) from non-native to native species, and lead to local co-extinction of a native parasite (T. varani) and native forest-dwelling hosts.},

Co-infection with two or more of these pathogens can increase the severity of health impacts. The risk of co-infection is intensified by the ecology of these three diseases because all three pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti) are transmitted by the same vector, blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), and are carried by many of the same reservoir hosts. The risk of exposure to multiple pathogens from a single tick bite and the sources of co-infected ticks are not well understood. In this study, we quantify the risk of co-infection by measuring infection prevalence in 4,368 questing nymphs throughout an endemic region for all three diseases (Dutchess County, NY) to determine if co-infections occur at frequencies other than predicted by independent assortment of pathogens. Further, we identify sources of co-infection by quantifying rates of co-infection on 3,275 larval ticks fed on known hosts. We find significant deviations of levels of coinfection in questing nymphs, most notably 83\% more co-infection with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi than predicted by chance alone. Further, this pattern of increased co-infection was observed in larval ticks that fed on small mammal hosts, but not on meso-mammal, sciurid, or avian hosts. Co-infections involving A. phagocytophilum were less common, and fewer co-infections of A. phagocytophilum and B. microti than predicted by chance were observed in both questing nymphs and larvae fed on small mammals. Medical practitioners should be aware of the elevated risk of B. microti/ B. burgdorferi co-infection.},

The Code details the responsibilities of investigators, animal carers, institutions and animal ethics committees (AECs), and all people involved in the care and use of animals, and describes processes for accountability. An obligation to respect animals underpins the Code. This obligation brings with it a responsibility to ensure that the care and use of animals for scientific purposes is ethically acceptable, balancing whether the potential effects on the wellbeing of the animals involved is justified by the potential benefits to humans, animals or the environment. The use of animals for scientific purposes must have scientific or educational merit; must aim to benefit humans, animals or the environment; and must be conducted with integrity. When animals are used, the number of animals involved must be minimised, the wellbeing of the animals must be supported, and harm, including pain and distress, in those animals must be avoided or minimised.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Parasites of the order Trypanosomatida are known due to their medical relevance. Trypanosomes cause African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease in South America, and Leishmania R oss , 1903 species mutilate and kill hundreds of thousands of people each year. However, human pathogens are very few when compared to the great diversity of trypanosomatids. Despite the progresses made in the past decades on understanding the evolution of this group of organisms, there are still many open questions which require robust phylogenetic markers to increase the resolution of trees. Methods Using two known 18S rDNA template structures (from Trypanosoma cruzi C hagas , 1909 and Trypanosoma brucei P limmer \& B radford , 1899), individual 18S rDNA secondary structures were predicted by homology modeling. Sequences and their secondary structures, automatically encoded by a 12-letter alphabet (each nucleotide with its three structural states, paired left, paired right, unpaired), were simultaneously aligned. Sequence-structure trees were generated by neighbor joining and/or maximum likelihood. Results With a few exceptions, all nodes within a sequence-structure maximum likelihood tree of 43 representative 18S rDNA sequence-structure pairs are robustly supported (bootstrap support {\textgreater}75). Even a quick and easy sequence-structure neighbor-joining analysis yields accurate results and enables reconstruction and discussion of the big picture for all 240 18S rDNA sequence-structure pairs of trypanosomatids that are currently available. Conclusions We reconstructed the phylogeny of a comprehensive sampling of trypanosomes evaluated in the context of trypanosomatid diversity, demonstrating that the simultaneous use of 18S rDNA sequence and secondary structure data can reconstruct robust phylogenetic trees.},

Strong cooperative links and coordination mechanisms exist between the human (public health) and animal arms of the health system in Australia. Wildlife is included in this system. Recent reviews of both the animal and human health sectors have highlighted Australia's relative strengths in the detection and management of emerging zoonotic diseases. However, the risks to Australia posed by diseases with wildlife as part of their epidemiology will almost certainly become greater with changing land use and climate change and as societal attitudes bring wildlife, livestock and people into closer contact. These risks are not isolated to Australia but are global. A greater emphasis on wildlife disease surveillance to assist in the detection of emerging infectious diseases and integration of wildlife health into One Health policy will be critical in better preparing Australia and other countries in their efforts to recognize and manage the adverse impacts of zoonotic diseases on human health.

	abstract = {Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus associated with high public health and economic burdens across Australia, but particularly in South East Queensland (SEQ). Despite this high burden, humans are considered incidental hosts. Transmission of RRV is maintained among mosquitoes and many nonhuman vertebrate reservoir hosts, although the relative contributions of each of these hosts are unclear. To clarify the importance of a range of vertebrates in RRV transmission in SEQ, a total of 595 serum samples from 31 species were examined for RRV exposure using a gold-standard plaque reduction neutralization test. Data were analyzed statistically using generalized linear models and a coefficient inference tree, and spatially. RRV exposure was highly variable between and within species groups. Critically, species group ("placental mammal," "marsupial," and "bird"), which has previously been used as a proxy for reservoir hosts, was a poor correlate for exposure. Instead, we found that generalized "diet" and greater "body mass" were most strongly correlated with seropositivity. We also identified significant differences in seropositivity between the two major possum species (ringtail possums and brushtail possums), which are ecologically and taxonomically different. Finally, we identified distinct hotspots and coldspots of seropositivity in nonhuman vertebrates, which correlated with human notification data. This is the largest diversity of species tested for RRV in a single study to date. The analysis methods within this study provide a framework for analyzing serological data in combination with species traits for other zoonotic disease, but more specifically for RRV highlight areas to target further public health research and surveillance effort.},

Here, the prevailing view of M. ulcerans as an aquatic pathogen has been questioned by recent research identifying native wildlife as potential terrestrial reservoirs of infection; specifically, treedwelling common ringtail and brushtail possums. In that previous work, sampling of environmental possum faeces detected a high prevalence of M. ulcerans DNA in established endemic areas for human BU on the Bellarine Peninsula, compared with non-endemic areas. Here, we report research from an emergent BU focus recently identified on the Mornington Peninsula, confirming associations between human BU and the presence of the aetiological agent in possum faeces, detected by real-time PCR targeting M. ulcerans IS2404, IS2606 and KR. Mycobacterium ulcerans DNA was detected in 20/216 (9.3\%) ground collected ringtail possum faecal samples and 4/6 (66.6\%) brushtail possum faecal samples. The distribution of the PCR positive possum faecal samples and human BU cases was highly focal: there was a significant nonrandom cluster of 16 M. ulcerans positive possum faecal sample points detected by spatial scan statistics (P,0.0001) within a circle of radius 0.42 km, within which were located the addresses of 6/12 human cases reported from the area to date; moreover, the highest sample PCR signal strength (equivalent to \$106 organisms per gram of faeces) was found in a sample point located within this cluster radius. Corresponding faecal samples collected from closely adjacent BU-free areas were predominantly negative. Possums may be useful sentinels to predict endemic spread of human BU in Victoria, for public health planning. Further research is needed to establish whether spatial associations represent evidence of direct or indirect transmission between possums and humans, and the mechanism by which this may occur.},

Recent advances in genomics have coalesced into powerful tools to monitor, detect, and reconstruct the role of pathogens impacting wildlife populations. Wildlife researchers are thus uniquely positioned to merge ecological and evolutionary studies with genomic technologies to exploit unprecedented "Big Data" tools in disease research; however, many researchers lack the training and expertise required to use these computationally intensive methodologies. To address this disparity, the inaugural "Genomics of Disease in Wildlife" workshop assembled early to mid-career professionals with expertise across scientific disciplines (e.g., genomics, wildlife biology, veterinary sciences, and conservation management) for training in the application of genomic tools to wildlife disease research. A horizon scanning-like exercise, an activity to identify forthcoming trends and challenges, performed by the workshop participants identified and discussed 5 themes considered to be the most pressing to the application of genomics in wildlife disease research: 1) "Improving communication," 2) "Methodological and analytical advancements," 3) "Translation into practice," 4) "Integrating landscape ecology and genomics," and 5) "Emerging new questions." Wide-ranging solutions from the horizon scan were international in scope, itemized both deficiencies and strengths in wildlife genomic initiatives, promoted the use of genomic technologies to unite wildlife and human disease research, and advocated best practices for optimal use of genomic tools in wildlife disease projects. The results offer a glimpse of the potential revolution in human and wildlife disease research possible through multi-disciplinary collaborations at local, regional, and global scales.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0003929},
	abstract = {Background Rodents are major reservoirs of pathogens responsible for numerous zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock. Assessing their microbial diversity at both the individual and population level is crucial for monitoring endemic infections and revealing microbial association patterns within reservoirs. Recently, NGS approaches have been employed to characterize microbial communities of different ecosystems. Yet, their relative efficacy has not been assessed. Here, we compared two NGS approaches, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 16S-metagenomics, assessing their ability to survey neglected zoonotic bacteria in rodent populations. Methodology/Principal Findings We first extracted nucleic acids from the spleens of 190 voles collected in France. RNA extracts were pooled, randomly retro-transcribed, then RNA-Seq was performed using HiSeq. Assembled bacterial sequences were assigned to the closest taxon registered in GenBank. DNA extracts were analyzed via a 16S-metagenomics approach using two sequencers: the 454 GS-FLX and the MiSeq. The V4 region of the gene coding for 16S rRNA was amplified for each sample using barcoded universal primers. Amplicons were multiplexed and processed on the distinct sequencers. The resulting datasets were de-multiplexed, and each read was processed through a pipeline to be taxonomically classified using the Ribosomal Database Project. Altogether, 45 pathogenic bacterial genera were detected. The bacteria identified by RNA-Seq were comparable to those detected by 16S-metagenomics approach processed with MiSeq (16S-MiSeq). In contrast, 21 of these pathogens went unnoticed when the 16S-metagenomics approach was processed via 454-pyrosequencing (16S-454). In addition, the 16S-metagenomics approaches revealed a high level of coinfection in bank voles. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that RNA-Seq and 16S-MiSeq are equally sensitive in detecting bacteria. Although only the 16S-MiSeq method enabled identification of bacteria in each individual reservoir, with subsequent derivation of bacterial prevalence in host populations, and generation of intra-reservoir patterns of bacterial interactions. Lastly, the number of bacterial reads obtained with the 16S-MiSeq could be a good proxy for bacterial prevalence.},

Traditional, reductionist approaches to investigate this dynamic often lack the scale and/or scope to faithfully model the dual and co-dependent nature of this relationship, limiting the success of translational efforts. With recent advances in large-scale, quantitative omics methods as well as in integrative analytical strategies, systems biology approaches for the study of infectious disease are quickly forming a new paradigm for how we understand and model host-pathogen relationships for translational applications.

	abstract = {Understanding the microbiome of ticks in Australia is of considerable interest given the ongoing debate over whether Lyme disease, and its causative agent the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi senso lato, are present in Australia. The diversity of bacteria infecting Australian ticks has been the subject of a number of studies using both culture and metagenomics based techniques. However, little is known about the virome of Australian ticks, including those that may have the potential to infect mammalian species. We used a meta transcriptomics approach to reveal the viral diversity within Australian ticks collected from two locations on the central-east coast of Australia, including metropolitan Sydney. From this we identified 19 novel species of RNA virus belonging to 10 families, as well as one previously described RNA virus. The majority of these viruses clustered phylogenetically with arthropod-associated viruses suggesting that they do not utilize mammalian hosts. However, two novel viruses discovered in ticks feeding on bandicoot marsupials clustered closely within the mammalian associated Hepacivirus and Pestivirus genera (Flaviviridae). Notably, another bandicoot tick yielded a novel Coltivirus (Reoviridae) -a group of largely tick-associated viruses containing the known human pathogen Colorado tick fever virus and its relative Eyach virus. Importantly, our transcriptomic data provided no evidence for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l.. in any tick sample, providing further evidence against the presence of Lyme Disease in Australia. In sum, this study reveals that Australian ticks harbor a diverse virome, including some viruses that merit additional screening in the context of emerging infectious disease.},

In this study, we established a model of A. phagocytophilum sheep infection and I. ricinus transmission using the European Norway variant 2 ovine strain (NV2Os) propagated in both IDE8 and ISE6 tick cells. Two sheep were inoculated with IDE8 tick cells infected with NV2Os. Both sheep developed A. phagocytophilum infection as determined by qPCR and PCR, the presence of fever 4 days post inoculation (dpi), the observation of morulae in granulocytes at 6 dpi, and the detection of A. phagocytophilum antibodies at 14 dpi. A. phagocytophilum was detected by PCR in skin, lung, small intestine, liver, spleen, uterus, bone marrow, and mesenteric lymph node from necropsies performed at 14 and 15 dpi. One sheep was infested during the acute phase of infection with I. ricinus nymphs from a pathogen-free colony. After molting, A. phagocytophilum transstadial transmission in ticks was validated with qPCR positive bacterial detection in 80\% of salivary glands and 90\% of midguts from female adults. Infected sheep blood collected at 14 dpi was demonstrated to be able to infect ISE6 tick cells, thus enabling the infection of two additional naive sheep, which then went on to develop similar clinical signs to the sheep infected previously. One of the sheep remained persistently infected until 115 dpi when it was euthanized, and transmitted bacteria to 70 and 2.7\% of nymphs engorged as larvae during the acute and persistent infection stages, respectively. We then demonstrated that these infected nymphs were able to transmit the bacteria to one of two other naive infested sheep. As expected, when I. ricinus females were engorged during the acute phase of infection, no A. phagocytophilum transovarial transmission was detected. The development of this new experimental model will facilitate future research on this tick-borne bacterium of increasing importance, and enable the evaluation of any new tick/transmission control strategies.},

A total of 1333 ticks (1021 nymphs and 312 adults) were separated into four groups, one for each pathogen and a negative control group. Ticks were fed artificially with bovine blood spiked with the respective Bartonella species. DNA was extracted from selected ticks to verify Bartonella-infection by PCR. DNA of Bartonella spp. was detected in 34\% of nymphs and females after feeding. The best engorgement results were obtained by ticks fed with B. henselae-spiked blood (65.3\%) and B. schoenbuchensis (61.6\%). Significantly more nymphs fed on infected blood (37.3\%) molted into adults compared to the control group (11.4\%). Bartonella DNA was found in 22\% of eggs laid by previously infected females and in 8.6\% of adults molted from infected nymphs. The transovarial and transstadial transmission of bartonellae suggest that I. ricinus could be a potential vector for three bacteria.},

The opportunity to examine a larger series of ticks from a wider range of hosts than previously available has led to the finding of a morphologically close and hitherto undescribed species, which is herewith described and named as Ixodes laridis sp.nov. The new species has a superficial similarity to its sibling, I. eudyptidis, but on close examination it displays a number of morphological differences that justify its taxonomic separation. Also, the hosts of the new species are principally gulls, gannets and cormorants, while I. eudyptidis is restricted to penguins. The recognition of this new species has implications for faunal lists in both New Zealand and Australia, as well for seabird health, as it appears that I. eudyptidis does not cause paresis as originally thought, but it is I. laridis that causes potentially fatal paralysis in its hosts. A taxonomic history and review of I. eudyptidis and keys to all stages of the species of Ixodes recorded from New Zealand, and from Australian seabirds are given. Reference to Ixodes kohlsi Arthur, 1955, a species currently restricted to Australia, is made for comparative purposes because of the similarity of both its morphology and host associations with the other species under consideration. Aspects of the distribution, zoogeography, hosts and ecology of all three species of ticks are discussed.},

Modern tick systematics is arguably in a state of current fl ux as increasing numbers of researchers endeavor to identify, classify, and phylogenetically interpret tick biodiversity using molecular methods. Despite this trend, morphology-based interpretations and especially identifi cations provide the cornerstone of tick systematics. In many parts of the world, especially under fi eld conditions, a light microscope and printed identifi cation keys or comparative illustrations are the only readily available tools that can consistently be used to identify ticks. Also, currently available computer-based tick identifi cation keys are based on morphological characters. Nevertheless, as molecular methods continue to be refi ned and the required laboratory equipment becomes more widespread, molecular tick identifi cation techniques will become more commonplace. However, morphological tick identifi cations will always be important, and we anticipate that competent morphologybased tick taxonomists will remain in demand. Some treatments of tick identifi cation, systematics, phylogenetics, or biogeography have combined morphological and molecular datasets in a type of "total evidence" approach (Klompen et al. 2000 ; Beati and Keirans 2001 ; Beati et al. 2008 ; Nava et al. 2009 ).},

Two deinocrotonids described as daggerDeinocroton draculi gen. et sp. nov. have specialised setae from dermestid beetle larvae (hastisetae) attached to their bodies, likely indicating cohabitation in a feathered dinosaur nest. A third conspecific specimen is blood-engorged, its anatomical features suggesting that deinocrotonids fed rapidly to engorgement and had multiple gonotrophic cycles.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.09.010},
	abstract = {The systematics of the genera and subgenera within the soft tick family Argasidae is not adequately resolved. Different classification schemes, reflecting diverse schools of scientific thought that elevated or downgraded groups to genera or subgenera, have been proposed. In the most recent classification scheme, Argas and Ornithodoros are paraphyletic and the placement of various subgenera remains uncertain because molecular data are lacking. Thus, reclassification of the Argasidae is required. This will enable an understanding of soft tick systematics within an evolutionary context. This study addressed that knowledge gap using mitochondrial genome and nuclear (18S and 28S ribosomal RNA) sequence data for representatives of the subgenera Alectorobius, Argas, Chiropterargas, Ogadenus, Ornamentum, Ornithodoros, Navis (subgen. nov.), Pavlovskyella, Persicargas, Proknekalia, Reticulinasus and Secretargas, from the Afrotropical, Nearctic and Palearctic regions. Hard tick species (Ixodidae) and a new representative of Nuttalliella namaqua (Nuttalliellidae), were also sequenced with a total of 83 whole mitochondrial genomes, 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA genes generated. The study confirmed the utility of next-generation sequencing to retrieve systematic markers. Paraphyly of Argas and Ornithodoros was resolved by systematic analysis and a new species list is proposed. This corresponds broadly with the morphological cladistic analysis of Klompen and Oliver (1993). Estimation of divergence times using molecular dating allowed dissection of phylogeographic patterns for argasid evolution. The discovery of cryptic species in the subgenera Chiropterargas, Ogadenus and Ornithodoros, suggests that cryptic speciation is common within the Argasidae. Cryptic speciation has implications for past biological studies of soft ticks. These are discussed in particular for the Ornithodoros (Ornithodoros) moubata and Ornithodoros (Ornithodoros) savignyi groups.},

Robertsicus, with the type species R. elaphensis (Price, 1959) n. comb., is proposed for Amblyomma elaphense, the tick of the Trans-Pecos rat-snake of the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico and southeastern USA (parts of Arizona, West Texas and New Mexico). Archaeocroton, with the type species Ar. sphenodonti (Dumbleton, 1943) n. comb., is proposed for Amblyomma sphenodonti, the tuatara tick of New Zealand. This is another step in the resolution of the systematic problems concerning the genus Aponomma, a heterogeneous group of eyeless ticks with a predilection for reptiles. By removing R. elaphensis (Price, 1959) and Ar. sphenodonti (Dumbleton, 1943) from the genus Amblyomma we have resolved, for now at least, the polyphyly of the genus Amblyomma. We have also resolved a 50-year old mystery: the identity of Hoogstraal's and Kaufman's "primitive" tick from the Carpathian Mountains that had a "striking resemblance" to Ar. sphenodonti n. comb.; it was an Ar. sphenodonti n. comb. that had travelled to the Carpathian Mountains from New Zealand on a captive tuatara},

Seven patients were male and two female. The fever duration varied from 4 to 120 days with a median of 6 days. All patients recalled previous tick attack. IgM was detected in four cases. Influenza like syndrome was the most frequent clinical form affecting five patients. Two patients had fever of unknown origin (FUO), one patient had blood culture-negative endocarditis and one had encephalitis. All patients except one recovered. Two patients were correctly treated. One patient with FUO had AIDS and unexplained pancytopenia.

In separate assays the 16S rRNA gene of Ehrlichia species and the 23S-5S rRNA spacer region of B. burgdorferi sensu lato were amplified and labeled by PCR. These PCR products were used in a reverse line blot hybridization assay in which oligonucleotide probes are covalently linked to a membrane in parallel lines. Hybridization of the samples with the oligonucleotide probes on this membrane enabled the simultaneous detection and identification of Ehrlichia, B. burgdorferi, and Bartonella species in 40 different samples. The application of the assay to DNA extracts from 121 Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from roe deer demonstrated that 45\% of these ticks carried Ehrlichia DNA. More than half of these positive ticks carried species with 16S rRNA gene sequences closely related to those of E. phagocytophila and the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent. The majority of the other positive ticks were infected with a newly identified Ehrlichia-like species. In addition, 13\% of the ticks were infected with one or more B. burgdorferi genospecies. In more than 70\% of the ticks 16S rRNA gene sequences for Bartonella species or other species closely related to Bartonella were found. In five of the ticks both Ehrlichia and B. burgdorferi species were detected.},

The organism is a small, obligate intracellular bacterium, which replicates within phagosomes in the cytoplasms of monocytes, granulocytes, or thromb- ocytes. It can infect human beings, dogs, horses, cattle, sheep, deer, cats, and mice, and leads to ehrlichiosis. Animal ehrlichiosis caused by the pathogen has now been reported throughout the world and at higher frequencies in tropical and subtropical regions. In Guangzhou, a city in the south of China, an outbreak of canine ehrli- chiosis was first described at a canine feed lot in 1998.1 The causative agents of this disease were identified soon after that: E. canis and E. platys caused the epi- demic disease simultaneously.2 A survey of epidemiology demonstrated that the positive rate of the serum against a recombinant E. chaffeensis p28, which was col- lected from the dogs around the district, reached 50\%. E. canis DNA was found in the brown dog ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) and Boophilus microplus from this area. It is obvious that canine ehrlichiosis is endemic in south of China. In this report we describe an Ehrlichia-like bacterium gene found in small mammals that were captured in this region.},

The goals of this study were to cultivate Ca. N. mikurensis in cell lines and to identify possible target cells for human infection. Blood components derived from infected patients were inoculated into cell lines of both tick and human origin. Bacterial growth in the cell cultures was monitored by real-time PCR and imaging flow cytometry. Ca. N. mikurensis was successfully propagated from the blood of immunocompromised neoehrlichiosis patients in two Ixodes spp. tick cell lines following incubation periods of 7-20 weeks. Human primary endothelial cells derived from skin microvasculature as well as pulmonary artery were also susceptible to infection with tick cell-derived bacteria. Finally, Ca. N. mikurensis was visualized within circulating endothelial cells of two neoehrlichiosis patients. To conclude, we report the first successful isolation and propagation of Ca.

We developed a real-time qPCR assay targeting the groEL gene of 'Candidatus N. mikurensis' and applied this assay to 949 I. ricinus ticks collected at several locations over 2 years. We found an overall prevalence of 6.0\%, which means that Candidatus N. mikurensis is one of the most common tick-transmitted zoonotic agents in this area. Co-infections with both 'Candidatus N. mikurensis' and B. afzelii occurred in 2.1\% of the ticks, which is significantly more than expected under random co-occurrence. The infection intensity (number of bacterial cells) of 'Candidatus N. mikurensis' was not affected by co-infection with B. afzelii, and vice versa. We conclude that there is a risk for simultaneous transmission of these 2 tick-borne pathogens. The potential medical consequences of this require further investigation.},

However, ticks and tick-borne pathogens associated with badgers are only partly known, and most of them have not yet been analysed with molecular biological methods The aim of this study was to perform molecular taxonomic analysis of ticks collected from a road-killed European badger, as well as to molecularly investigate its ticks and blood sample for the presence of Anaplasmataceae and piroplasms. Ticks from the badger were morphologically identified as females of Ixodes rugicollis. Based on its cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA sequences, I. rugicollis phylogenetically clustered together with I. lividus and I. arboricola, i.e. other members of the subgenus Pholeoixodes. The blood sample of the badger contained the DNA of Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp. (FU98) recently identified in red fox in Austria and the Czech Republic. This genotype is most closely related to Ca. N. lotoris (from raccoons in North America), and has lower sequence identity with the I. ricinus-transmitted zoonotic agent, Ca. N. mikurensis found in Eurasia. In the blood of the badger and in one female I. rugicollis, the DNA of a new Babesia genotype was also present, which differed from a piroplasm detected in M. meles in Spain, and clustered phylogenetically in the B. microti clade. Phylogenetic analysis of I. rugicollis (based on two genetic markers) confirms its status in subgenus Pholeoixodes. Ca. Neoehrlichia sp. (FU98) was identified for the first time in M. meles and in Hungary. In addition, a molecularly previously not yet characterized Babesia genotype occurs in badgers in Central Europe.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes one of the most important flavivirus infections of the central nervous system, affecting humans in Europe and Asia. It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected tick and circulates among them and their vertebrate hosts. Until now, TBE risk analysis in Germany has been based on the incidence of human cases. Because of an increasing vaccination rate, this approach might be misleading, especially in regions of low virus circulation. METHOD: To test the suitability of rodents as a surrogate marker for virus spread, laboratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV and analyzed over a period of 100 days by real-time (RT)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with autochthonous TBE cases, was determined and compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas. RESULTS: In experimentally infected M. arvalis voles, TBEV was detectable in different organs for at least 3 months and in blood for 1 month. Ten percent of all rodents investigated were positive for TBEV. However, in TBE risk areas, the infection rate was higher compared with that of areas with only single human cases or of nonrisk areas. TBEV was detected in six rodent species: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. M. glareolus showed a high infection rate in all areas investigated. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The infection experiments proved that TBEV can be reliably detected in infected M. arvalis voles. These voles developed a persistent TBE infection without clinical symptoms. Further, the study showed that rodents, especially M. glareolus, are promising sentinels particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation.},

The disease is named after Victor Babes, the Hungarian pathologist and microbiologist who identified intraerythrocytic microorganisms as the cause of febrile hemoglobinuria in cattle in 1888.1 Five years later, Theobald Smith and Frederick L. Kilborne identified a tick as the vector for transmission of Babesia bigemina in Texas cattle.2 This seminal observation established for the first time that an arthropod could transmit an infectious agent to a vertebrate host. The first documented human case of babesiosis was not recognized until about a half century later, when a splenectomized Croatian herdsman rapidly succumbed to an infection subsequently attributed to B. divergens.3 The first case in an immunocompetent person was identified on Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts, in 1969.4 The causative agent was B. microti, and the vector was the Ixodes dammini tick (now referred to as I. scapularis).5 Additional cases occurred on the island, and the disease became known as "Nantucket fever." During the past decade, the incidence and geographic distribution of babesiosis have increased in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions of the United States. B. microti infection is almost as common as Lyme disease in some areas of southern New England, an observation that is consistent with the high prevalence of B. microti-infected ticks in the region.6-8 Babesiosis is now classified as a nationally notifiable disease and is recognized as an emerging health risk in several parts of the world.9,10},

	abstract = {Human babesiosis is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus Babesia that are obligate parasites of red blood cells. Long recognized as pathogens imposing a significant health burden on domesticated animals, Babesia spp. increasingly have been identified over the last 50 years as a cause of infection in people throughout the world. The first reference to babesiosis is probably in Exodus 9:3, which describes the plague visited upon the cattle of Pharaoh Rameses II. Viktor Babes, a Hungarian pathologist who investigated the cause of febrile hemoglobinuria in cattle grazing in the Danube region of Romania, was the first to document a microorganism residing in red blood cells.[1] Shortly thereafter, Smith and Kilborne identified a similar organism in Texas cattle.[2] Named Pyrosoma bigeminum after its pear shape, the protozoan was later recognized as Babesia bigemina. The cattle tick, Boophilus annulatus, was identified as the vector for transmission of Texas cattle fever. By making this seminal observation, Smith and Kilborne established the concept that hematophagous arthropods can transmit an infectious agent to vertebrate hosts. More than 100 species of babesia subsequently have been identified in wild and domestic animals.[3] The first human case of babesiosis was identified in 1957 near Zagreb, Croatia.[4] A young farmer had been grazing cattle on tick-infested pastures and presented with fever, anemia and hemoglobinuria. He was asplenic and died of renal insufficiency during the second week of illness. Initially reported as Babesia bovis, the agent most likely was Babesia divergens, another pathogen of cattle. In 1968, B. divergens was confirmed as the etiologic agent in an asplenic person infected while vacationing in the Irish countryside.[5] While these asplenic cases were attracting the attention of physicians in Europe, babesiosis was diagnosed in several residents of Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts. The causative agent was determined to be Babesia microti, which typically infects mice and other small rodents.[6] Spielman and colleagues subsequently identified the vector as Ixodes dammini (also known as I. scapularis) and recognized the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as an important natural host.[7-10] In the 1990's, Babesia duncani (WA1) was identified in human cases reported from the northern Pacific coast,[11] and a B. divergens- like organism in a case from Missouri (MO1).[12] Another Babesia spp. was identified in asplenic patients from the Tyrol region of Austria and the Alpine region of Italy in 2003.[13] They experienced a severe illness caused by EU1, a species closely related to B. odocoilei and known to infect white-tailed deer. Additional babesial species infecting humans have been identified in Taiwan (TW1)[14] and Korea (KO1).[15] Initially diagnosed in Europe and North America, human babesiosis is now reported from around the world.},

On each continent it has been associated with a different species of tick. The original isolate (Thai Tick Typhus strain TT-118) was from a pool of larval Ixodes and Rhipicephalus ticks. Later it was detected in I. granulatus from Rattus rattus. Its pathogenicity for humans has not yet been confirmed in Thailand, but it is possibly responsible for the Spotted Fever Group human rickettsiosis in Thailand. The strain from Texas (USA) was isolated from Amblyomma cajennense ticks taken from cattle. Its pathogenicity for humans has not yet been confirmed in Texas. However, this tick is known to bite humans. The strain from Flinders Island (Australia) described as R. honei, has been isolated from patients with "Flinders Island Spotted Fever" and from Aponomma hydrosauri ticks taken from blue-tongue lizards ( Tiliqua nigrolutea), tiger snakes (Notechis ater humphreysi), and copperhead snakes (Austrelaps superbus) on Flinders Island.

This extension of the known geographic range of R. honei infection may be explained, in part, by alterations in host-parasite ecology Two spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsia species endemic to Australia are known human pathogens - Rickettsia australis and Rickettsia honei. 1 R. australis, the agent of Queensland tick typhus (QTT), is transmitted by ticks of the genus Ixodes, principally I. holocyclus, 2,3 and has been associated with infections along the eastern seaboard from tropical north Queensland to Wilsons Promontory, in Victoria. The hosts for these tick vectors are mammals, including native rats and bandicoots.2 Confirmed cases of R. honei infection, or Flinders Island spotted fever, have previously been described only on Flinders Island, in Bass Strait,4 although a rickettsial spotted fever illness, possibly caused by R. honei, has also recently been reported from the east coast of Tasmania.5 Recently published findings indicate that the parasitic tick Aponomma hydrosauri, which has a variety of reptile species as its hosts, may be the principal vector of R. honei. 6 We describe four patients from coastal South Australia (SA) near Adelaide who presented with an illness characterised by fever, severe malaise, diffuse maculopapular rash, and laboratory findings indicating acute SFG rickettsial infection.},

	title = {Rickettsiales and rickettsial diseases in {Australia}},
	abstract = {Currently, there are 12 known Rickettsiales species in Australia. However research into the diversity and range of these agents in Australia is still far from complete. A sero-epidemiological study was undertaken around the city of Launceston in Tasmania, Australia to determine the level of exposure to spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsia among the local cat and dog population. The study showed that over 50\% of the dogs and cats tested were positive for SFG rickettsiae antibodies. However, no correlation was observed between the animals' health and seropositivity at the time of testing. Ixodes tasmani ticks collected from Tasmanian devils in Tasmania were tested for the presence of SFG and typhus group (TG) rickettsiae using a specific real time PCR (qPCR), and 55\% were found to be positive. The gltA, rompA, rompB and sca4 genes were then sequenced. Using the current criteria this new rickettsia qualified as a Candidatus species, and was named Candidatus Rickettsia tasmanensis, after the location from which it was first detected. Soft ticks of the species Argas dewae were collected from bat roosting boxes north of Melbourne. Of the ten ticks collected, seven (70\%) were positive for SFG rickettsiae using the qPCR mentioned above. An isolate was obtained using cell culture isolation methods and the rrs, gltA, rompA, rompB and sca4 genes were sequenced. Using the current criteria this new rickettsia qualified as a novel species, and was tentatively named Rickettsia argasii sp. nov. after the tick genus from which it was isolated. Four family members and their neighbour living in metropolitan Victoria became ill after exposure to a flea-infested kitten. Initial serological analysis indicated a typhus group (TG) rickettsial infection. However, testing of fleas from the group of cats in Lara, Victoria, where the kitten originated, revealed the presence of R. felis, the agent of cat flea typhus. This was the first case of human infection with R. felis in Australia and the first detection of R. felis in fleas in Victoria. A tourist returning to Australia from the United Arab Emirates was diagnosed with a scrub typhus group (STG) rickettsial infection and the agent was isolated from their blood. Analysis of the rrs and 47kDa genes showed significant divergence compared to all available strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi. Due to the degree of genetic divergence and the geographically unique origin of this isolate it was considered to be a new species, which has been tentatively named Orientia chuto, with `chuto' being Japanese for `Middle East'. Dogs in central and northern Australia were tested for Anaplasma platys using a specifically designed real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. Of the 68 dogs tested, 27 (40\%) were positive for A. platys DNA, including six dogs from Western Australia. This was the first report of A. platys in Western Australia. These studies offer an insight into the range and diversity of Rickettsiales and rickettsial diseases previously unrecognised in Australia.},

Additionally, both B. tachyglossi and B. turcica contain paralogous vsp and vlp proteins homologous to those used in the multiphasic antigen-switching system used by relapsing fever Borrelia to evade vertebrate immune responses, although their number was greatly reduced compared to human-infectious species.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To attribute a cause and quantify allergic-like symptoms observed among island residents. DESIGN: Skin prick tests and intradermal injections with ultraviolet-irradiated, filtered (0.22 microns) whole-body homogenates of the soft tick, Ornithodoros capensis, were used to reproduce experimentally the symptoms observed. SETTING: Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Island residents were designated as such after having spent more than 1 month on the island during the summer seabird breeding season. INTERVENTIONS: Control measures were instigated using a residual insecticide, delta-methrin, sprayed inside sleeping quarters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acaricide spraying reduced (X2 = 4.42; P less than 0.05) the number of island residents complaining of having been bitten by ticks, yet was considered an inefficient control measure as 67\% reported being attacked by ticks after spraying. RESULTS: Among 97 island residents, elevated total IgE levels were associated with reaction to tick bite in 11 cases (X2 = 27.17; P less than 0.001), but were not of reliable diagnostic value. Symptoms included intense pruritus, blistering (a major feature), erythema, weeping lesions, lymphangitis, dull ache, rheumatic pain and general lassitude, and intense discomfort. Sera from two of four volunteers with known reactions to O. capensis and one of four others with reactions to the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, cross-reacted with antigens from a total of four of six biting/stinging and non-biting arthropods (radioallergosorbent tests). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms associated with reactions to tick bite peaked in severity at 35-40 hours and thus the response was most likely delayed type IV hypersensitivity.},

Sequences from other apicomplexans among the Sarcocystiidae, Eimeriidae, Theileriidae, Plasmodiidae, Cryptosporiidae, and Babesiidae, a Perkinsus species and 2 dinoflagellates were obtained from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium, and Hepatozoon form a monophyletic group distinct from representatives of other apicomplexan families. Although equivocal, our analysis indicated that Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium are sister taxa and that Hepatozoon is basal to them. To evaluate phylogenetic affinities among H. americanum, H. canis, and other species of Hepatozoon, we examined 18 morphologic and life-cycle features of 13 species currently assigned to Hepatozoon. This analysis indicates paraphyly of Hepatozoon (as currently arranged) because Hepatozoon lygosomarum was found most closely related to Hemolivia mauritanicum. These results, combined with results of previous studies, support elevating Hepatozoon to familial level (Hepatozoidae) as originally suggested by Wenyon in 1926. Both DNA sequence data and morphologic and life-cycle characters support a sistergroup relationship between H. americanum and H. canis.},

Recent reports of a high seroprevalance of C. burnetii in Australian dogs, along with the identification of additional Coxiella species within R. sanguineus ticks, has prompted an investigation into the presence and identification of Coxiella species in R. sanguineus ticks in Australia. Using a combination of C. burnetii species-specific IS1111a transposase gene and Coxiella genus-specific 16S rRNA PCR assays, a Coxiella sp. was identified in 100\% (n=199) of R. sanguineus ticks analysed, and C. burnetii was not detected in any R. sanguineus ticks studied. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed the Coxiella sequences were closely related to Coxiella sp. identified previously in R. sanguineus and R. turanicus ticks overseas. This study illustrates the value of using genus specific PCR assays to detect previously unreported bacterial species. Furthermore, the presence of an additional Coxiella sp. in Australia requires further investigation into its potential for contributing to serological cross-reactions during Q fever testing.},

This long ignored boophilid was previously known as R. microplus Canestrini for specimens reported in Australia and New Caledonia. The adults of R. australis are easily recognized by a combination of characters, such as the ventro-medial spurs in the palpal segments of the male, and the abundant, plumose, pale white setae on the dorsum of the female. Other details, such as coxal and adanal shields are more variable among different populations and may lead to incorrect determinations. Larvae of R. australis are clearly smaller than those of R. microplus. The use of principal components analysis on body measurements leads to a clear separation of larvae of both taxa. A phylogenetic analysis based on 12S- and 16S-rDNA gene sequences supports the conspecifcity of the neotype material on which the reinstatement of the species is proposed, and of the specimens used for previous interspecifc crosses. R. australis is now known to be present in Australia, New Caledonia, the island of Borneo, Philippines, Sumatra, Java, New Guinea, Cambodia, and Tahiti. Both R. microplus and R. australis coexist in some countries in southeastern Asia. Given the extreme importance of these ticks for the cattle industry, feld data on their distribution in the region are required to know the actual range of these species and to understand the evolution of the group.},

Ticks spend most of their lives in the external environment away from the host and are thus expected to be affected by changes in climate. Most empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate or predict range shifts or increases in ticks and tick-borne diseases, but there can be a lot of heterogeneity in such predictions. Tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. Modeling studies can help tease apart and understand the roles of different drivers of change. Predictive models can also be invaluable in projecting changes according to different climate change scenarios. However, validating these models remains challenging, and estimating uncertainty in predictions is essential. Another focus for future research should be assessing the resilience of ticks and tick-borne pathogens to climate change.},

Here we summarise data collected through surveillance during 2010-2016, and compare with previous TSS data from 2005 to 2009, particularly in relation to the primary Lyme borreliosis vector Ixodes ricinus. 4173 records were submitted, constituting {\textgreater}14,000 ticks; 97\% were endemic tick records (13,833 ticks of 11 species), with an additional 97 records of imported ticks (438 ticks of 17 species). Tick submissions were mainly from veterinary professionals (n=1954; 46.8\%) and members of the public and amateur entomologists (n=1600; 38.3\%), as well as from academic institutions (n=249; 6.0\%), wildlife groups (n=239; 5.7\%) and health professionals (n=131; 3.1\%). The most commonly reported hosts of endemic ticks were dogs (n=1593; 39.1\% of all records), humans (n=835; 20.5\%) and cats (n=569; 14\%). New host associations were recorded for a number of tick species. Ixodes ricinus was the most frequently recorded endemic tick species (n=2413; 59.2\% of all records), followed by I. hexagonus (n=1355; 33.2\%), I. canisuga (n=132; 3.2\%) and I. frontalis (n=56; 1.4\%), with other species each making up {\textless}1\% total records. 81\% of I. ricinus recorded from humans were nymphs, whereas 93.4\% of I. ricinus from companion animals were adults. Recent TSS records of I. ricinus in the UK add a considerable amount of new presence data for this species, particularly in the southern regions of England, and confirm that this species is widespread across the UK.

Predominant host groups include companion animals (411 records), humans (198 records), wild birds (111 records), and large wild mammals (88 records), with records also from small/medium wild mammals, livestock, the environment and domestic/aviary birds. The scheme has elucidated the detection of two nonnative tick species, the expansion of previously geographically restricted D. reticulatus and produced ground data on the spread of I. ricinus in southwest England. It has also provided a forum for submission of ticks from the concerned public and particularly those infected with Lyme borreliosis, thus raising awareness among public health agencies of the increased peri-urban tick problem in Britain. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to run a cost-effective nationwide surveillance program to successfully monitor endemic tick species, identify subtle changes in their distribution, and detect the arrival and presence of exotic species.},

Arboviruses monitored by NAMP include bluetongue, Akabane and BEF viruses. BTV infection does not adversely affect production in Australian livestock, and disease has not been reported from areas of known viral transmission. Australia's economy benefits from the export of ruminant livestock and their reproductive material (semen and embryos). This trade depends on a mutual confidence between Australia and its trading partners that risks to the animal health status of the importing country can be accurately assessed and properly managed. NAMP provides credible data on the nature and distribution of important, specific arbovirus infections in Australia for use by the Australian Government, its trading partners and livestock exporters. NAMP underpins Australian Government export certification that Australian ruminants are sourced from areas that are free from transmission of these specified arboviruses. In addition, NAMP data is used during market access negotiations. NAMP is jointly funded by its primary beneficiaries: the cattle, sheep and goat industries; the livestock export industry; and the state, territory and Australian governments.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {An epidemic form of arthritis has been occurring in eastern Connecticut at least since 1972, with the peak incidence of new cases in the summer and early fall. Its identification has been possible because of tight geographic clustering in some areas, and because of a characteristic preceding skin lesion in some patients. The authors studied 51 residents of three contiguous Connecticut communities -39 children and 12 adults -who developed an illness characterized by recurrent attacks of asymmetric swelling and pain in a few large joints, especially the knee. Attacks were usually short (median: 1 week) with much longer intervening periods of complete remission (median: 2.5 months), but some attacks lasted for months. To date the typical patient has had three recurrences, but 16 patients have had none. A median of 4 weeks (range: 1-24) before the onset of arthritis, 13 patients (25\%) noted an erythematous papule that developed into an expanding, red, annular lesion, as much as 50 cm in diameter. Only 2 of 159 family members of patients had such a lesion and did not develop arthritis (P less than 0.000001). The overalll prevalence of the arthritis was 4.3 cases per 1,000 residents, but the prevalence among children living on four roads was 1 in 10. Six families had more than 1 affected member. Nine of 20 symptomatic patients had low serum C3 levels, compared to none of 31 asymptomatic patients (P less than 0.005); no patient had iridocyclitis or a positive test for antinuclear antibodies. Neither cultures of synovium and synovial fluid nor serologic tests were positive for agents known to cause arthritis. "Lynne arthritis" is thought to be a previously unrecognized clinical entity, the epidemiology of which suggests transmission by an arthropod vector.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {To the Editor: The authors of "A new tick-borne encephalitis-like virus infecting New England deer ticks, Ixodes dammini" (1) provide useful information regarding a possibly new tick-borne encephalitis-like virus. However, the use of the name Ixodes dammini is not accurate for describing this species. I. dammini (Spielman, Clifford, Piesman, and Corwin) was synonymized with Ixodes scapularis (Say) in 1993 by Oliver et al. (2) and was redescribed in 1996 (3) to reduce confusion regarding identification. Keirans and colleagues summarize a wide array of rigorous studies involving hybridization, assortative mating, isozymes, and morphometrics, all of which provide evidence supporting the synonymization of the two tick species (3). The synonymization of I. dammini with I. scapularis has been widely accepted. "I. scapularis (= I. dammini)" is still often used, but the use of I. scapularis as the sole nomen for this species is becoming more common (4). Oliver et al. (2) have established I. dammini as a junior subjective synonym of I. scapularis. If scientifically rigorous evidence exists justifying the reestablishment of the species name I. dammini, it must be published according to proper procedure. The proper nomenclature of any species, let alone one of such widespread notoriety and public health importance, is too important to be relegated to a footnote. Until such evidence is presented, the continued misuse of I. dammini serves only to confuse health-care providers, public health professionals, and lay persons. On a secondary matter, on page 167 of the dispatch, the authors state that "I. (Pholeoixodes) cookei is a one-host tick that is only distantly related to I. dammini and only rarely feeds on humans or mice" (1). I. cookei is a three-host tick (D.E. Sonenshine, pers. comm.), as are all the members of the genus Ixodes.},

No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the "MEGALIGN" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.},

The evolutionary relationships among the Francisella-like endosymbionts (FLE) from different hosts and between FLE and the arthropod-borne pathogen F. tularensis are not known. A 1,169-base fragment of the 16s rDNA and a 713-base fragment of the F. tularensis 17-kDa lipoprotein gene homolog of the FLE of six North American Dermacentor tick species [D. anderson, D. variabilis, D. albipictus (Packard), D. occidentalis Marx, D. hunteri Bishopp, and D. (Anocentor) nitens Neumann] and of Amblyomma maculatum Koch and Ornithodoros porcinus (Murry 1877, sensu Walton 1979) as outgroups, were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. These gene phylogenies were compared with a phylogeny of the same tick species constructed from a 435-base fragment of the tick mitochondrial 16s rDNA. Although the phylogenies of the FLE and their tick hosts are parallel at the genus level, the Dermacentor FLE are unresolved at the species level. The FLE and the Dermacentor ticks show little sign of co-speciation, possibly indicating that the association between these endosymbiont and the Dermacentor ticks is of a relatively recent origin. Several ticks were co-infected, either with two FLE with divergent 17-kDa lipoprotein gene sequences or with FLE and an unidentified species of spotted fever group rickettsia (alpha-proteobacteria). Infection with FLE does not seem to have precluded infection with either a second closely related gamma-proteobacterial symbiont or with a second less closely related alpha-proteobacterial symbiont.},

Similarly, bacteria within the family Anaplasmataceae have been considered to be of veterinary importance only, yet three species have been implicated in human diseases in recent years, including Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of human anaplasmosis (formerly known as "human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent", E. equi and E. phagocytophila), and finally Ehrlichia ewingii, which causes granulocytic ehrlichiosis in humans. We present here an overview of the various tick- and flea-borne rickettsial zoonoses described in the last 20 years, focusing on the ecological, epidemiological and clinical aspects.},

Microbiome sequencing confirmed the presence of low levels of A. phagocytophilum DNA in the blood of rodents, dogs and cattle, while high levels of A. platys and Anaplasma sp.

Directed sequencing of the 16S rRNA and gltA genes in selected samples revealed the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in humans, dogs and rodents and highlighted its importance as a possible contributing cause of AFI in South Africa. A number of recently described Anaplasma species and A. platys were also detected in the study. Phylogenetic analyses grouped Anaplasma sp. SA/ZAM dog into a distinct clade, with sufficient divergence from other Anaplasma species to warrant classification as a separate species.

To evaluate the effects that amplicon clustering methods have on the discovery of novel diversity, we clustered an environmental marine high-throughput sequencing dataset of protist amplicons together with reference sequences from the taxonomically curated Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR(2)) database using three de novo approaches: sequence similarity networks, USEARCH, and Swarm. The potentially novel diversity uncovered by each clustering approach differed drastically in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and in the number of environmental amplicons in these novel diversity OTUs. Global pairwise alignment comparisons revealed that numerous amplicons classified as potentially novel by USEARCH and Swarm were more than 97\% similar to references of PR(2). Using shortest path analyses on sequence similarity network OTUs and Swarm OTUs we found additional novel diversity within OTUs that would have gone unnoticed without further exploiting their underlying network topologies. These results demonstrate that graph theory provides powerful tools for microbial ecology and the analysis of environmental high-throughput sequencing datasets. Furthermore, sequence similarity networks were most accurate in delineating novel diversity from previously discovered diversity.},

We compare two next-generation sequencing techniques - amplicon and shotgun - on water samples across four of Brazil's major river floodplain systems (Amazon, Araguaia, Parana, and Pantanal). Less than 50\% of phyla identified via amplicon sequencing were recovered from shotgun sequencing, clearly challenging the dogma that mid-depth shotgun recovers more diversity than amplicon-based approaches. Amplicon sequencing also revealed {\textasciitilde}27\% more families. Overall the amplicon data were more robust across both biodiversity and community ecology analyses at different taxonomic scales. Our work doubles the sampling size in similar environmental studies, and novelly integrates environmental data (e.g., pH, temperature, nutrients) from each site, revealing divergent correlations depending on which data are used. While myriad variants on NGS techniques and bioinformatic pipelines are available, our results point to core differences that have not been highlighted in any studies to date. Given the low number of taxa identified when coupling shotgun data with clade-based taxonomic algorithms, previous studies that quantified biodiversity using such bioinformatic tools should be viewed cautiously or re-analyzed. Nonetheless, shotgun has complementary advantages that should be weighed when designing projects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is much speculation on which hypervariable region provides the highest bacterial specificity in 16S rRNA sequencing. The optimum solution to prevent bias and to obtain a comprehensive view of complex bacterial communities would be to sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene; however, this is not possible with second generation standard library design and short-read next-generation sequencing technology. METHODS: This paper examines a new process using seven hypervariable or V regions of the 16S rRNA (six amplicons: V2, V3, V4, V6-7, V8, and V9) processed simultaneously on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Four mock samples were amplified using the 16S Ion Metagenomics Kit (Life Technologies) and their sequencing data is subjected to a novel analytical pipeline. RESULTS: Results are presented at family and genus level. The Kullback-Leibler divergence (DKL), a measure of the departure of the computed from the nominal bacterial distribution in the mock samples, was used to infer which region performed best at the family and genus levels. Three different hypervariable regions, V2, V4, and V6-7, produced the lowest divergence compared to the known mock sample. The V9 region gave the highest (worst) average DKL while the V4 gave the lowest (best) average DKL. In addition to having a high DKL, the V9 region in both the forward and reverse directions performed the worst finding only 17\% and 53\% of the known family level and 12\% and 47\% of the genus level bacteria, while results from the forward and reverse V4 region identified all 17 family level bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analysis have shown that our sequencing methods using 6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA and subsequent analysis is valid. This method also allowed for the assessment of how well each of the variable regions might perform simultaneously. Our findings will provide the basis for future work intended to assess microbial abundance at different time points throughout a clinical protocol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are widely used in environmental microbiology and molecular evolution as reliable markers for the taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analysis of microbes. Restricted by current sequencing techniques, the massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons encompassing the full length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of the most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic classification is still debated. In the present study, several bioinformatics tools were integrated to build an in silico pipeline to evaluate the phylogenetic sensitivity of the hypervariable regions compared with the corresponding full-length sequences. RESULTS: The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred from the geodesic distance, a parameter that is applied to quantitatively compare the topology of different phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from different sub-regions. The relationship between different sub-regions based on the geodesic distance indicated that V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the full-length 16S rRNA sequences in the phylogenetic analysis of most bacterial phyla, while V2 and V8 were the least reliable regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that V4-V6 might be optimal sub-regions for the design of universal primers with superior phylogenetic resolution for bacterial phyla. A potential relationship between function and the evolution of 16S rRNA is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Ticks vector diverse pathogenic bacteria that are important to identify in public health and veterinary contexts. Technological advances in high throughput sequencing have given an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively characterize bacterial associates of ticks, but recent studies have used different 16S rRNA variable regions and sequence read lengths with little consideration of whether they reveal the same bacterial diversity. We compare the effectiveness of bacterial surveys using three library preparations across nine 16S variable regions and a set of 12 tick specimens (Acari: Ixodidae). We identify the bacterial assemblages present in extractions from wild-collected Ixodes scapularis from two regions of Canada, and provide the first microbiome survey for Ixodes angustus. Four bacterial families accounted for most diversity, with Rickettsiaceae being replaced as most common by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonadaceae in some I. scapularis, and Francisellaceae being most abundant in I. angustus. The commercially available Ion 16S kit, based on 6 amplicons representing 16S regions V2, V3, V4, V67, V8 and V9, gave the most comprehensive estimates of bacterial families, with the Ion V4 amplicon generally giving the highest estimated diversity. Sequencing of the V4 amplicon by the MR DNA commercial service also provided cost effective assays of tick microbiomes that were within the range of results from the Ion 16S kit. Subtraction of the number of reads found in an extraction control sample lowered estimates of the number of bacterial families by approximately half. Our study shows that diversity patterns obtained from 16S microbiome surveys depend on the amplicon and protocol used, demonstrating that more than one marker region is needed to provide reliable inferences.},

Many software packages for analyzing microbial sequences such as the 16S gene from 454 sequencers and Illumina platforms are available. But for a new researcher, it is difficult to know which package to choose. We present a systematic review of packages for the analysis of molecular sequences used to describe and compare microbial communities. This review gives students and researchers information to help choose the best analytic pipeline for their project. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of such software. Findings: Seven software packages met our inclusion criteria of being cost free and publically available, offering analysis functions from platform sequencing to results presentation, and included documentation and data security. We installed and executed each of the software packages and describe the installation, documentation, features, and functions of each. Conclusions: For the user, pipeline choices may be limited because some packages only run on select operating systems. Users should be aware of the availability of features and functions of each package. Of utmost importance is that the user must be aware of the default settings and underlying assumptions of each function. All packages are lacking sufficient methods for longitudinal analysis. Researchers can do well using any one of these seven packages. However, two packages are outstanding; mothur and QIIME, due not only to the comprehensive suite of functions and procedures incorporated into the pipelines but also because of the accompanying documentation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. METHODS: When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. RESULTS: VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. DISCUSSION: VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.},

	abstract = {Bacterial diversity among environmental samples is commonly assessed with PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequences. Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short sequences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70\%. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel organisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys.},

	abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the 'rare biosphere', is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli MG1655 as a reference template, we find that 16S rDNA diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

Pyrosequencing libraries typically vary widely in the number of sequences per sample, even within individual studies, and there is a need to revisit the behaviour of richness estimators and diversity indices with variable gene sequence library sizes. Multiple reports and review papers have demonstrated the bias in non-parametric richness estimators (e.g. Chao1 and ACE) and diversity indices when using clone libraries. However, we found that biased community comparisons are accumulating in the literature. Here we demonstrate the effects of sample size on Chao1, ACE, CatchAll, Shannon, Chao-Shen and Simpson's estimations specifically using pyrosequencing libraries.

	abstract = {The rickettsioses of the "Far East" or Asia-Australia-Pacific region include but are not limited to endemic typhus, scrub typhus, and more recently, tick typhus or spotted fever. These diseases embody the diversity of rickettsial disease worldwide and allow us to interconnect the various contributions to this special issue of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease. The impact of rickettsial diseases-particularly of scrub typhus-was substantial during the wars and "police actions" of the last 80 years. However, the post-World War II arrival of effective antibiotics reduced their impact, when recognized and adequately treated (chloramphenicol and tetracyclines). Presently, however, scrub typhus appears to be emerging and spreading into regions not previously reported. Better diagnostics, or higher population mobility, change in antimicrobial policies, even global warming, have been proposed as possible culprits of this phenomenon. Further, sporadic reports of possible antibiotic resistance have received the attention of clinicians and epidemiologists, raising interest in developing and testing novel diagnostics to facilitate medical diagnosis. We present a brief history of rickettsial diseases, their relative importance within the region, focusing on the so-called "tsutsugamushi triangle", the past and present impact of these diseases within the region, and indicate how historically, these often-confused diseases were ingeniously distinguished from each another. Moreover, we will discuss the importance of DNA-sequencing efforts for Orientia tsutsugamushi, obtained from patient blood, vector chiggers, and rodent reservoirs, particularly for the dominant 56-kD type-specific antigen gene (tsa56), and whole-genome sequences, which are increasing our knowledge of the diversity of this unique agent. We explore and discuss the potential of sequencing and other effective tools to geographically trace rickettsial disease agents, and develop control strategies to better mitigate the rickettsioses.},

Since the last reclassification of Anaplasmataceae twenty years ago, two new Anaplasma species have been identified. To date, the genus includes eight Anaplasma species (A. phagocytophilum, A. marginale, A. centrale, A. ovis, A. bovis, A. platys, A. odocoilei, and A. capra) and a large number of unclassified genovariants that cannot be assigned to known species. Members of the genus can cause infection in humans and a wide range of domestic animals with different degrees of severity. Long-term persistence which, in some cases, is manifested as cyclic bacteremia has been demonstrated for several Anaplasma species. Zoonotic potential has been shown for A. phagocytophilum, the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and for some other Anaplasma spp. that suggests a broader medical relevance of this genus. Genetic diversity of Anaplasma spp. has been intensively studied in recent years, and it has been shown that some Anaplasma spp. can be considered as a complex of genetically distinct lineages differing by geography, vectors, and host tropism. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge concerning the natural history, pathogenic properties, and genetic diversity of Anaplasma spp. and some unclassified genovariants with particular attention to their genetic characteristics. The high genetic variability of Anaplasma spp. prompted us to conduct a detailed phylogenetic analysis for different Anaplasma species and unclassified genovariants, which were included in this review. The genotyping of unclassified genovariants has led to the identification of at least four distinct clades that might be considered in future as new candidate species.},

Several species, including as Mycoplasma arthritidis , are nonglycolytic and can use arginine as their source of energy. Described here are the genome sequence and a transposon library of M. arthritidis . The genome of 820,453 bp is typical in size for a mycoplasma and contains two large families of genes that are predicted to code for phase-variable proteins. The transposon library was constructed using a minitransposon that inserts stably into the mycoplasma genome. Of the 635 predicted coding regions, 218 were disrupted in a library of 1,100 members. Dispensable genes included the gene coding for the MAM superantigen and genes coding for ribosomal proteins S15, S18, and L15.},

(2) Methods: Spleen tissue of 74 sympatric wild cervids (30 roe deer, 7 fallow deer, 22 sika deer, 15 red deer) and of 27 red deer from a farm from southeastern Germany were analyzed by molecular methods for the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia species. (3) Results: Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia DNA was demonstrated in 90.5\% and 47.3\% of the 74 combined wild cervids and 14.8\% and 18.5\% of the farmed deer, respectively. Twelve 16S rRNA variants of A. phagocytophilum were delineated. While the infection rate for A. phagocytophilum among the four cervid species was similar (71.4\% to 100\%), it varied significantly for Babesia between roe deer (73.3\%), fallow deer (14.3\%), sika deer (27.3\%) and red deer (40.0\%). Deer <2 years of age tested significantly more often positive than the older deer for both A. phagocytophilum and Babesia species. (4) Conclusions: This study confirms the widespread occurrence of A. phagocytophilum and Babesia species in wild cervids and farmed red deer in Germany and documents the co-occurrence of the two tick-borne pathogens in free-ranging sika deer.},

	abstract = {Human babesiosis in Europe has been attributed to infection with Babesia divergens and, to a lesser extent, with Babesia venatorum and Babesia microti, which are all transmitted to humans through a bite of Ixodes ricinus. These Babesia species circulate in the Netherlands, but autochthonous human babesiosis cases have not been reported so far. To gain more insight into the natural sources of these Babesia species, their presence in reservoir hosts and in I. ricinus was examined. Moreover, part of the ticks were tested for co-infections with other tick borne pathogens. In a cross-sectional study, qPCR-detection was used to determine the presence of Babesia species in 4611 tissue samples from 27 mammalian species and 13 bird species. Reverse line blotting (RLB) and qPCR detection of Babesia species were used to test 25,849 questing I. ricinus. Fragments of the 18S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from PCR-positive isolates were sequenced for confirmation and species identification and species-specific PCR reactions were performed on samples with suspected mixed infections. Babesia microti was found in two widespread rodent species: Myodes glareolus and Apodemus sylvaticus, whereas B. divergens was detected in the geographically restricted Cervus elaphus and Bison bonasus, and occasionally in free-ranging Ovis aries. B. venatorum was detected in the ubiquitous Capreolus capreolus, and occasionally in free-ranging O. aries. Species-specific PCR revealed co-infections in C. capreolus and C. elaphus, resulting in higher prevalence of B. venatorum and B. divergens than disclosed by qPCR detection, followed by 18S rDNA and COI sequencing. The non-zoonotic Babesia species found were Babesia capreoli, Babesia vulpes, Babesia sp. deer clade, and badger-associated Babesia species. The infection rate of zoonotic Babesia species in questing I. ricinus ticks was higher for Babesia clade I (2.6\%) than Babesia clade X (1.9\%). Co-infection of B. microti with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Neoehrlichia mikurensis in questing nymphs occurred more than expected, which reflects their mutual reservoir hosts, and suggests the possibility of co-transmission of these three pathogens to humans during a tick bite. The ubiquitous spread and abundance of B. microti and B. venatorum in their reservoir hosts and questing ticks imply some level of human exposure through tick bites. The restricted distribution of the wild reservoir hosts for B. divergens and its low infection rate in ticks might contribute to the absence of reported autochthonous cases of human babesiosis in the Netherlands.},

	abstract = {Babesiosis is an emerging zoonotic disease on all inhabited continents and various wildlife species are the principal reservoir hosts for zoonotic Babesia species. The primary vectors of Babesia are Ixodid ticks, with the majority of zoonotic species being transmitted by species in the genus Ixodes. Species of Babesia vary in their infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity for people. Various factors (e.g., increased interactions between people and the environment, increased immunosuppression, changes in landscape and climate, and shifts in host and vector species abundance and community structures) have led to an increase in tick-borne diseases in people, including babesiosis. Furthermore, because babesiosis is now a reportable disease in several states in the United States, and it is the most common blood transfusion-associated parasite, recognized infections are expected to increase. Because of the zoonotic nature of these parasites, it is essential that we understand the natural history (especially reservoirs and vectors) so that appropriate control and prevention measures can be implemented. Considerable work has been conducted on the ecology of Babesia microti and Babesia divergens, the two most common causes of babesiosis in the United States and Europe, respectively. However, unfortunately, for many of the zoonotic Babesia species, the reservoir(s) and/or tick vector(s) are unknown. We review the current knowledge regarding the ecology of Babesia among their reservoir and tick hosts with an emphasis of the role on wildlife as reservoirs. We hope to encourage the molecular characterization of Babesia from potential reservoirs and vectors as well from people. These data are necessary so that informed decisions can be made regarding potential vectors and the potential role of wildlife in the ecology of a novel Babesia when it is detected in a human patient. o 2012 Australian Society for Parasitology Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We indicate rules that should be observed in recording weather data, to avoid serendipitous correlations between the density of ticks and climate variables and recommend the inclusion of raw data in reports. We stress the need for standardized methods to collect ticks that cannot be obtained by standard flagging. The reporting of infection rates of pathogens in ticks should avoid conclusions based on pure molecular findings in feeding ticks. Studies demonstrating the vectorial capacity of ticks should not be supported only by molecular surveys of feeding ticks. Vacuous conclusions about vectorial or reservoir status based solely on the finding of genomic material of a pathogen should be discouraged. We stress that phylogenetic studies based on random selection of sequences from GenBank are unsuitable. We firmly support the development of a dedicated server of curated sequences of ticks and pathogens as a standard for future studies.},

Hepatozoon is a genus of apicomplexan parasites that is transmitted by ingestion of infected arthropod vectors. However, alternative modes of transmission have been identified such as trophic transmission. Using the 18S rRNA gene as a marker, we provide an assessment of Hepatozoon prevalence in six wild canid and two rodent species collected between 2003 and 2012 from remote areas in North Africa. By combining this with other predator-prey systems in a phylogenetic framework, we investigate Hepatozoon transmission dynamics in distinct host taxa. Prevalence was high overall among host species (African jerboa Jaculus jaculus [17/47, 36\%], greater Egyptian jerboa Jaculus orientalis [5/7, 71\%], side-striped jackal Canis adustus [1/2, 50\%], golden jackal Canis aureus [6/32, 18\%], pale fox Vulpes pallida [14/28, 50\%], Rui ppell's fox Vulpes rueppellii [6/11, 55\%], red fox Vulpes vulpes [8/ 16, 50\%], and fennec fox Vulpes zerda [7/11, 42\%]). Phylogenetic analysis showed further evidence of occasional transmission of Hepatozoon lineages from prey to canid predators, which seems to occur less frequently than in other predator-prey systems such as between snakes and lizards. Due to the complex nature of the Hepatozoon lifecycle (heteroxenous and vector-borne), future studies on these wild host species need to clarify the dynamics of alternative modes of Hepatozoon transmission and identify reservoir and definitive hosts in natural populations. We also detected putative Babesia spp. (Apicomplexa: Piroplasmida) infections in two canid species from this region, V. pallida (1/28) and V. zerda (1/11).},

	abstract = {The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vectorborne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales.},

Molecular and morphological data sets were first examined separately. The molecular data were analyzed by maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining distance methods; the morphological data were analyzed by MP After their level of congruence was evaluated by a partition homogeneity test, all characters were combined and analyzed by MP The branches of the tree obtained by combining the data sets were better resolved than those of the trees inferred from the separate analyses. Boophilus is monophyletic and arose within Rhipicephalus. Boophilus species clustered with species of the Rhipicephalus evertsi group. Most of the clustering within Rhipicephalus was, however, consistent with previous classifications based on morphological data. Morphological characters were traced on the molecular reconstruction in order to identify characters diagnostic for monophyletic clades. Within the Rhipicephalus sanguineus complex, the sequences of specimens morphologically identified as Rhipicephalus turanicus were characterized by a high level of variability, indicating that R. turanicus-like morphology may cover a spectrum of distinct species.},

However, the mode of transmission of Australian trypanosomes is unknown since their vectors remain unidentified. Here we aimed to fill this current knowledge gap about the occurrence and identity of indigenous trypanosomes in Australian invertebrates by conducting molecular screening for the presence of Trypanosoma spp. in native ticks collected from south-west Australia. A total of 231 ticks (148 collected from vegetation and 83 retrieved directly from 76 marsupial hosts) were screened for Trypanosoma using a High-Resolution Melt ({HRM}) {qPCR} assay. An overall Trypanosoma {qPCR} positivity of 37\% (46/125) and 34\% (26/76) was detected in questing ticks and host-collected (i.e., feeding) ticks, respectively. Of these, sequencing revealed 28\% (35/125) of questing and 28\% (21/76) of feeding ticks were infected with one or more of the five species of trypanosome previously reported in this region (T. copemani, T. noyesi, T. vegrandis, T. gilletti, Trypanosoma sp. {ANU}2). This work has confirmed that Australian ticks are capable of harbouring several species of indigenous trypanosome and likely serve as their vectors.},
