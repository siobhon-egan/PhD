Therefore, research aimed ; ) identify ticks Australian wildlife; ii) investigate bacteria haemoprotozoa present wildlife ticks; iii) characterise microbes understand interplay host-microbe-tick. Molecular tools used assist identification Australian ticks. Museum specimens human biting tick Amblyomma triguttatum used investigate molecular systematics species complex. set molecular barcodes developed Australian ticks, important accurate identification immature life stages cryptic species. Additionally, novel 12S rDNA metabarcoding assay developed high throughput identification ticks. Free-ranging animals ticks sampled urban peri-urban areas. bacterial haemoprotozoan diversity characterised using combination amplicon high-throughput sequencing, targeted Sanger sequencing, microscopy. Bacterial profiling generated 100 million sequences. Statistical analysis using constrained ordination methods revealed blood, tick tissues distinct community signatures. diverse range tick associated microbes identified, Anaplasmataceae, Bartonellaceae, Borreliaceae, Coxiellaceae, Midichloriaceae. Overall, microbes rare wildlife hosts generally confined specific sample types. addition, eight species haemoprotozoa identified, including species within genera Babesia, Hepatozoon, Theileria Trypanosoma.

Paparini et al. 2015)) generalists (e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi infects wide range mammals (Clement et al. 2020)). However, true diversity epidemiology species remains unknown.Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii, largest extant marsupial carnivore. present across mainland Australia (~3,000 years ago), distribution wild populations Tasmanian devils became restricted island Tasmania (Bruniche-Olsen et al. 2018), southern coast Australian mainland. Biogeographical events influenced declines effective size devil populations distribution, consequential genetic bottleneck resulting low genetic diversity (M. E. Jones et al. 2004; Bruniche-Olsen et al. 2018; Patton et al. 2019). Since 1996, transmissible cancer (devil tumour facial disease, DFTD hereafter) gradually spread across distributional range species caused local population declines upwards 80% (McCallum et al. 2009; Lazenby et al. 2018). Transmission DFTD occurs direct transfer live tumour cells individuals devils bite social interactions (Pearse Swift 2006; Hamede, McCallum, Jones 2013; D. G. Hamilton et al. 2019). Survival DFTD infected individuals usually 6-12 months clinical signs appear; disease lethal almost 100% cases (Pye, Woods, Kreiss 2016). consequence transmission driven social interactions, DFTD still present even largely depleted populations hosts (McCallum et al. 2009). Therefore, additional pressure(s) host health, co-infections haemoparasites, threaten imperilled populations, yet, little known devil’s parasite community (Wait, Peck, et al. 2017).date, four protozoan parasite groups identified wild devil populations; Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Toxoplasma gondii Sarcocystis sp. previous study identified sporulated sporocysts consistent Sarcocystis (family: Sarcocystidae) species intestinal mucosa using microscopic examination (Munday et al. 1978). north-west Tasmania, T. gondii prevalence higher carnivorous marsupials Tasmanian devil, spotted-tail quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) eastern quoll (D. viverrinus), compared sympatric prey marsupials like brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), Bennett’s wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus, syn.

Recently, Cryptosporidium Giardia spp. also identified faecal samples wild devils using molecular techniques (Wait, Fox, et al. 2017).past two decades use molecular techniques significantly extended understanding haemoprotozoan parasites. result, revealed Australian marsupials monotremes can host high diversity haemoprotozoa species, unique Australia (C.
