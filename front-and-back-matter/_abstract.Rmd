Ticks (Ixodida) represent one of the most important vector groups affecting human and animal health, and in recent years there have been increasing concerns regarding the cause of tick-borne disease affecting Australians. Worldwide, wildlife health surveillance is recognised as a key tool for investigating tick-borne infections and a One Health approach is essential to understand the epidemiology of tick-associated microbes. Therefore, this research aimed to; i) identify ticks from Australian wildlife; ii) investigate bacteria and haemoprotozoa present in wildlife and ticks; and iii) characterise microbes and understand the interplay between host-microbe-tick. Molecular tools were used to assist in the identification of Australian ticks. Museum specimens of the human biting tick *Amblyomma triguttatum* were used to investigate the molecular systematics of this species complex. A set of molecular barcodes was developed for Australian ticks, which was important for the accurate identification of immature life stages and cryptic species. Additionally, a novel 12S rDNA metabarcoding assay was developed for high throughput identification of ticks. Free-ranging animals and their ticks were sampled from urban and peri-urban areas. The bacterial and haemoprotozoan diversity was characterised using a combination of amplicon high-throughput sequencing, targeted Sanger sequencing, and microscopy. Bacterial profiling generated over 100 million sequences. Statistical analysis using constrained ordination methods revealed blood, tick and tissues had distinct community signatures. A diverse range of tick associated microbes was identified, such as *Anaplasmataceae*, *Bartonellaceae*, *Borreliaceae*, *Coxiellaceae*, *Midichloriaceae.*  Overall, these microbes were rare in wildlife hosts and generally confined to specific sample types. In addition, eight species of haemoprotozoa were identified, including species within the genera *Babesia*, *Hepatozoon*, *Theileria* and *Trypanosoma.* Lastly, this study further confirmed the absence of northern hemisphere tick-borne pathogens and provided further evidence of the unique microbes present in Australian wildlife and ticks.
