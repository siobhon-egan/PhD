Firstly I would like to thank by Principal Supervisor Dr. Charlotte Oskam. 
I will forever be grateful for your fierce support and mentorship over these last few years. 
From the first email I sent all those years ago now, you have always been so generous with your time. 
I thank you dearly for your advice, kindness and guidance throughout this journey.

To Prof. Peter Irwin, thank you for welcoming me in and providing me the platform to explore the wonderful world of wildlife and parasites. 
It has been an honour to share in this project and I will forever be grateful at the unique chance to learn from you and share some great memories in the field.

To Prof. Una Ryan, your kindness and generosity truly is one-of-kind. 
Thank you for the support, opportunities and advice you have provided throughout this time.
It has been a delight to learn from you and share in the delicious supply of baked good!

A project like this is not possible without a small army of help. Completing a PhD project in wildlife zoonoses has been an honour. 
It has led me on a fantastic journey and granted me the pleasure of experiencing some wonderful place.

A huge thank you to Prof. Peter Banks and Casey Taylor at the University of Sydney. This project would not able been possible without you both. Thank you for being generous hosts and fantastic collaborators. An extended thank you to the Banks lab for support and assistance with field work.

To Dr. Jill Austen, a massive thank you for your loyal support and friendship. 
Thank you for generously welcoming me into the Austen family and making me feel so comfortable. You very quickly become fundamental to this project and I will be forever grateful for all you did to help achieve this.

I owe a huge debt to Dr. Amy Northover. It never crossed my mind to pursue research until our paths met, thank you for your mentorship and continued support. Thank you also to Sarah Keatley, many moons ago you so very patiently introduced me to the lab world and I have never look backed.

Thank you to the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attraction team at the Perth Hills and surrounds for allowing me to tag along during field sessions. In particular, to Rebecca Kay, Douglas Giles and Hannah Kilian. Thank you to Jade Kelly, Dr. Amanda Barbosa and volunteers for assistance in fieldwork and sample collection.

A special mention to Dr. Joe Fontaine - early on in my PhD journey you provided some much valued direction, mentorship and extended connections. I thank you and the team for always obliging to collect ticks!

To Dr. Bruce Halliday, thank you for your warm hospitality at the Australian National Insect Collection in Canberra and always assisting in queries and requests for more ticks! I also thank Prof. Ian Beveridge (Melbourne University), Dr. Mark Harvey (Western Autsralian Museum),  Dr. Owen Seeman (Queensland Museum) for providing advice on and access to tick collections.

Access to specimens and controls was vital for validation assays. I thank Dr. Jill Austen, Dr. Amanda Barbosa, Dr. Andrea Paparini, A/Prof. Chris Peacock and The Australian Rickettsial Reference Laboratory.

An extended thank you to the Cryptick Lab group, members past and present. Thank you for the good cheer, coffee runs and friendship over the years.

A big thank you to Frances Brigg and Dr. David Berryman (Western Australian State Agricultural Biotechnology Centre), Dr. David Chandler, Dr. Christopher Noune and Dr. Matthew Stevens (Australian Genomics Research Facility) for assistance with assays and sequencing. 

Finally to my family, who laid the foundation for me to make all this possible.
To mum (Denice), Allan, Katie, Rhys and Luke I wouldn't be who I am today without you all. Your love and support makes up the heart and soul of this work.
To my partner Ray, thank for you for being my biggest support and making it possible to reach the end of this journey. 
I know it has has not always been easy but thank you for pushing me forward and never letting me give in.
